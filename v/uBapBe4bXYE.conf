title = "6 Reasons To Get A Bike Fit | Improve Your Position On The Bike"
description = "Having a specialist fit can have a significant difference on many aspects of your cycling. As a triathlete, there are even more reasons to seek expert advice. So what are the essential benefits to having a professional bike fit? \n\nIf you're not comfortable on your bike, you're likely to avoid riding it and straight away, that's going to effect your performance and limit your potential. There are quite a few things you can do to help improve your comfort. Doing a regular stretching and strength programme will help you get into the desired position whilst maintaining the comfort. A good bike fit will identify the areas you can work on and find a position that's comfortable for you and it will mean you want to get on your bike and stay on it for many hours. \n\nThe more efficient you are on the bike, the faster you'll be able to go for the same amount of effort and energy. Without having to get stronger or fitter, you can find more power just by tweaking your position. So basically, being more efficient means free speed. \n\nSadly it's often a reactive rather than a proactive reason to go and get a bike fit. There can be some many ways in which you can get an injury. But often it's doing something slightly wrong hundreds and hundreds of times. On the plus side, that means often a tiny tweak such as just moving your saddle height a minimal amount can reduce the pain and prevent any future injuries. \n\nOne of the main reasons for investing in a time trial bike is to be more aerodynamic. When you got a really fast bike like this, there's no point in sitting on it in a really upright position because straight away you'll outweigh any of the benefits. Getting the perfect aero position will probably have some compromises and that's why expert advice can come in handy. \n\nIt's a fact that it's often easily overlooked but of course you need to have good control of the bike. Now when getting fitted, it often closely linked with your comfort and efficiency. Although some triathlon and time trial courses can be straight forward, having good control of a bike is essential. \n\nA significant difference in getting a fit on a triathlon bike compared to a standard time trial bike is having to consider the run leg straight after the bike. Now it's quite a challenge for the body expecting it to run efficiently after working hard cycling but getting a few tweaks and especially focusing on the angle of your hips can make a very positive difference very quickly. \n\nThose are the benefits of having a professional bike fit. And by making a few small changes, you can take your cycling to the next level.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3y\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/3z\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCaught Up - Da Tooby\nDress Code Black 3 - Niklas AhlstroÃàm\nRetriever - Henrik Olsson\nYou X You - Henrik Olsson\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Top 5 T1 Transition Tips - http://gtn.io/T1Tips\nüìπ  How To Train With Heart Rate - http://gtn.io/RunHR\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
