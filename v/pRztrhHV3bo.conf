description = "When it comes to clothing and kit, there are a lot of options for a triathlon race. If you wear a trisuit, should you race in a one piece or two piece triathlon suit?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/iO \n\nThe idea with a tri-suit is that you wear it throughout the whole duration of a triathlon, that means it needs to be comfortable for the swim, bike and run. \n\nAs a general rule of thumb, a one piece is well suited to the short distance events, whilst a two piece is nicely suited to the longer events.
