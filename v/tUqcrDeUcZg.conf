title = "Tri Suit Vs Wetsuit - Which Is Fastest? | GTN Does Science"
description = "Heather and Mark investigate which is fastest for the swimming leg of triathlon - wetsuit or no wetsuit?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/ar\n\nWetsuits can help add buoyancy and potentially improve your swimming technique. Many believe that you are faster with a wetsuit so we try to find out! However, changing out of a wetsuit is not always easy and can add a delay. For our experiment, Heather and Mark swim 400m in both of the suits and add the time it takes taking off their wetsuit. We extrapolated these results to give a more accurate representation of a longer swim. The presenters then get their science glasses on to analyse the data!\n\nDo you prefer swimming in a wetsuit? üëá \n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/aq\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ GTN Top 5 T1 Tips http://gtn.io/T1Tips\nüìπ Remove Your Wetsuit Quickly http://gtn.io/WetsuitRemoval\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \nSummer Trip - Felix Johansson Carne\nPink And Blue - Oomiee\nDazed Summer - Molife\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
