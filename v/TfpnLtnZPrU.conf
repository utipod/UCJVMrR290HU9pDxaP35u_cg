title = "How To Make Your Triathlon Bike More Comfortable"
description = "Holding an aerodynamic position on a triathlon or time trial bike can be uncomfortable, but with the correct fit and components it doesn't have to be. Aero bars are a completely different fit and position than a normal road bike, but allow you ride faster and further. Mark shows you how to make your aero position comfortable.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/eY \n\nSpending time setting up your position dialled will pay dividends in speed. Having the right saddle height and position is really important, and can be very different from your road bike. The general rule of thumb is that you should raise your saddle and move it slightly forwards. Dedicated time trial or triathlon saddles are available which offer better comfort in the different position. As ever with saddles though, saddle choice can be very personal. Ultimately use the saddle that works for you.\n\nMastering aero bars is one of the biggest improvements you can make, but they take time and patience to set up correctly. The great thing about aero bars is that they can be endlessly tweaked in the pursuit of speed. The poles and base-bar can be easily moved fore and aft, and the poles rotated to suit your particular position. Setting the width of the poles and pads is a trade off between comfort, control and speed. You will find that as you become more experienced at riding in the aero tuck you will be able to comfortably move your elbow pads closer together to become more aerodynamic. Additionally on aero bars it is important to not feel too stretched out as this will not only be an uncomfortable position but will also give you less control at speed.\n\nLastly lower tyre pressure will take some of the harshness out of the ride, and also add some grip in corners.\n\nDon't forget though that to be really comfortable on your aero bike you have to spend time riding in the position and working on your core so that you can maintain the aero tuck. Maybe get a friend to video you riding in the position so you can look at it and make changes accordingly. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/eX\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Comfort vs Aero | http://gtn.io/ComfortVsAero\nüìπ Clip On Aero Bars vs Drops | http://gtn.io/AeroBarsVsDrops\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nBacklash (Instrumental Version) - Da Tooby\nBoogie Man - Mo Stacks\nDecember Madness - Damma Beatz\nMitsuwa - SINY\nMotor Town - Da Tooby\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
