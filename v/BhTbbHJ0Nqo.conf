description = "Heather Wurtele took time out of her hectic race schedule to show Heather her custom Parlee 1R, Aqua Sphere wetsuit, custom Endura trisuit and some special new Endura D2Z Aeroswitch helmets.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/b1\n\nParlee worked with Heather to create a custom cockpit set up so that she can get into a low aero position. The 1R features a Shimano Dura Ace 9150 Di2  groupset, with TRP disc brakes providing plenty of reliable stopping power, which even come with a carbon aerodynamic cover. The Parlee is equipped with a front wheel from Heather's long term partner Enve, and a HED rear disc. A Rotor 2INpower crankset with a neat single construction 53/39 chainrings is paired to an Ultegra 8000 rear derailleur, which has some very bling CeramicSpeed jockey wheels.\n\nWhat do you think of her bike and tri kit?
