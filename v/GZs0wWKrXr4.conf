description = "Sarah True's journey to the Ironman World Championships in Kona has been an eventful one! With two DNF's before qualifying late in the summer at Ironman Mont Tremblant, it's been a year of experiences and Sarah has shared her thoughts with GTN!\n\nWith special thanks to Ben & Sarah | True Tube! \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/te\n\nSarah True knows all about the term fourth. The America finished in the position no athlete really wants at the pinnacle of sporting endeavour, the Olympic Games in London 2012.\n\nHaving moved on from draft legal ITU racing after her 2nd Games in Rio 2016, she moved up to the Ironman 70.3 distance with relative ease, securing 4th place at the Chattanooga event in 2017. Fast forward to 2018, and once again the first spot after the podium was hers at the Hawaii Ironman, that 4th place representing a superb debut at the event. \n\nHowever, 2019 proved to be a year of drama, with True collapsing whilst holding the lead in not one, but two Ironman events during the marathon. She grabbed her slot at the last available weekend of qualifying, and that means Kona will be her.. Yes you guessed it.. her FOURTH Ironman since June! \n\nSo in this video Fraser chat's with Sarah all about the highs and lows of this year so far, and how it has felt for her!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. 👍\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/td\n\nWatch more on GTN...\n📹 Sarah True's Specialized Shiv Disc 👉 https://gtn.io/SarahTrueProBike\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nGive It All Up (Explicit Version) - Pastis\n\nPhotos: © Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers – and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we’re here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube’s best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
