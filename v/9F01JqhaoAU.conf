title = "Barefoot Running | GTN Investigates The Pros And Cons"
description = "Barefoot running was never something that I had recommended to me as an athlete, and as a result, I didn‚Äôt try it. So, I‚Äôm keen to explore the development of barefoot running through my own investigation and with the added help of top level podiatrists. Ultimately, should you try barefoot running or are you better off sticking with trainers?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7T\n\nI did find that barefoot running felt really nice on the plantar fascia on the bottom of my foot, an area that I find gets tight when doing a high running volume in my trainers. It naturally stretched it out and let the foot move as it is designed to. On the other hand, I did feel my calves working harder, something that is expected with barefoot running. If you do want to incorporate more barefoot running into your training, then plenty of stretches of the calves and strengthening exercises will help the transition.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed taking my shoes off and running free it made me realise that most of the western world is not suitable for actual barefoot running due to the surfaces and external environmental factors. If I did take barefoot running further I‚Äôd start by introducing some running in a more minimalist shoe to at least give me some protection.\n\nI am not going to change anything dramatically after this investigation. I had so many injuries as a young athlete that had a lot to do with my gait and control and I‚Äôm not willing to risk returning to the basics and reduce my ability to run long distances and race as I can now. Simply, if it‚Äôs not broken then don‚Äôt fix it. \n\nHowever, I will say that I think my foot muscles have got lazy and I‚Äôm going to reintegrate some barefoot work at the end of hard session such as warming down on grass and doing a little conditioning work in the sand when conditions permit.\n\nIf you found this video interesting then make sure to give it a thumbs up and share with your running friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/7S\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ 8 Key Stretches To Improve Your Flexibility - http://gtn.io/8Stretches\nüìπ How To Run A Fast Half Marathon With GCN's Dan Lloyd - http://gtn.io/FastHalfMarathon\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
