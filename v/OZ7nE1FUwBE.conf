description = "Mark versus Heather & A Horse! It‚Äôs a race but this time Mark has his work cut out, he‚Äôs on foot and Heather will be seeking the assistance of her horse on the Dartmoor hills in Devon! We were inspired by the annual race held in Wales where you can enter either as a runner or a rider. Who will win?! \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/I3\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ   GTN Lanzarote Hill Climb Challenge üëâ  https://gtn.io/CyclistVsRunner \nüìπ  GTN's Coastal Challenge üëâ  https://gtn.io/CyclistVsRunner \n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nES_A Journalist's Dream - Out To The World\nES_When Worlds Collide - Hampus Naeselius\nES_Swiss Miss Blues - Carvings \nES_Spike Hair - Josef Falkenskold\nES_Perimeter Breach - Wendel Scherer\nES_Metamorpheus - Hampus Naeselius\nES_Late Night Lady - Carvings\nES_Horse Snort 2 - SFX Producer\nES_Horse Gallop Away 2 - SFX Producer\nES_Hold on Tight - Hampus Naeselius\nES_Feed My Ego - Sven Karlsson\nES_Close to the Edge - Hampus Naeseliu\nES_Bass Four - Johan Hynynen\nES_Bad Company - Rockin' For Decades\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
