description = "Through the winter months it is really important that you wash your bike after every ride. But it can be really hard to find the motivation after a cold, wet ride. So Mark teaches you how to wash your bike in five minutes here.                     \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/4-\n\nFirst spray degreaser on your chain. This will get to work while you wash the rest of your bike. Be sure not to spray on any braking surfaces.\n\nWhen washing your bike with soapy water, start at the top of the bike and work down. \n\nTake your wheels out of the frame to allow you to clean inside the forks and chainstays.\n\nGive your tyres and rims a good clean while the wheels are off the bike. Also the degreaser should have loosened a lot of the dirt from the cassette by now, so give that a wipe down as well.\n\nFinally, once the wheels are back on the bike, clean all the degreaser from the chain before applying a chain lube.\n\nDo you like to keep your bike very clean, let us know in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/50\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Kenyan Hills Running Session - http://gtn.io/4y\nüìπ  GTN's Winter Training Tips - http://gtn.io/Wintertips\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
