description = "*Quick disclaimer - We're not saying you have to try this - it's just a bit of fun - Merry Xmas!* Well we don‚Äôt want to put you off as food and drink on offer is one of the highlights of the festive period but did you know that the average Christmas meal actually contains around 5000 calories?! Mark, Heather & Fraser have all gone & come up with their own plans and put them to the test!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/wb\n\nWe know it‚Äôs hard to keep portions under control and keep track of just how many calories get consumed on Christmas day and after all, it‚Äôs nice to just sit and enjoy the food and not think about it too much. \n\nWell we don‚Äôt want to put you off as the food and drink on offer is one of the highlights of the festive period but did you know that the average Christmas meal actually contains around 5000 calories?!\n\nAdmittedly we are skipping the starter and nibbles and leaving out the dessert so with just one compulsory glass of bubbles or in the boy's case beer realistically we are consuming more like 2200 calories here.\n\nSo what if we consume all of this and then find a way to burn it off, you know, try to limit the damage to our waistlines! Mark, Heather & Fraser have all gone away and come up with their own plans and put them to the test!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/wa \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ 1000 Calorie Challenge | The Fastest Way To Burn 1000 Calories Running? üëâ https://gtn.io/1000Calorie\nüìπ Cyclist Vs Runner | GTN Lanzarote Hill Climb Challenge üëâ https://gtn.io/CyclistVsRunner\n\nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nA Christmas Dance - Arthur Benson\n200 Dont's (Instrumental Version) - Conditional\nHis Little Helpers - Arthur Benson\nFire Fireplace 1 - SFX Producer\nRockin' Bobby - Billy Bill\nEggnog Boogie - Chimney Givers\nBeer, Beards & BBQ - Rockin' For Decades\nOn a Mission - Robert Ruth\nRight on Time (Instrumental Version) - OTE\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal-winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nFelt bicycles: https://gtn.io/Felt\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
