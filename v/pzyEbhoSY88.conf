title = "What Is The Optimal Cycling Cadence For You To Run Faster Off The Bike? | GTN Does Science"
description = "The first ever GTN does science is here! In this video we test the optimal cycling cadence to help you run off the bike efficiently in your next triathlon. What is your prediction?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/2v\n\nThe relationship between your bike cadence and your run cadence off the bike has long been debated. It is commonly thought that your run cadence should match your cycling cadence, but is there any truth in this?\n\nFor this experiment we are at the Team Bath lab with head physiologist Jonathon Robinson. The test involved 3 sets of a 10 minute bike ride, followed by a 5 minute run off the bike. The run will be at the same cadence (170spm) but the bike will be done at varying cadences (65, 85 and 105rpm). Mark will complete these tests at his sprint distance intensity and Heather will do this at her her half-ironman intensity.\n\nAs there is not much evidence on this subject we tested everything including VO2, heart rate, lactate and perceived effort of exertion.\n\nCheck out the full video for the results and let us know your predictions in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/2w\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Drops Vs Clip On Aero Bars - http://gtn.io/AeroBarsVsDrops\nüìπ  How To Improve Your Run Cadence - http://gtn.io/RunCadence \n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
