description = "Dan Lloyd from the Global Cycling Network removed his socks a few months ago to explain what road cyclists could learn from triathletes. Now its our turn to listen and learn with 5 things triathletes can learn from roadies.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7N\n\nGroup riding:\nRiding with a group containing a few riders that are stronger than you can be a fantastic way to push yourself just that little bit further and harder. Thereâ€™s nothing quite like trying to hold onto the wheel of a stronger rider either on a climb or the flat, itâ€™s something that can push you in way that simply canâ€™t be done when training on your own. \n\nMix up your training:\nAs a triathlete itâ€™s easy to fall into the trap of getting stuck in a bit of a rut training wise. And by that I mean riding at one set intensity, so most of your kilometres in the zone thatâ€™s between easy and hard. However, the key to becoming a well-rounded cyclist is to mix up your routine by riding at varying intensities. \n\nRace tactics:\nTriathletes who do draft-legal races can learn a lot from cycling, tactically. Whether itâ€™s working as a team to protect one rider, or how to get away and stay away in bike section, or simply how to get round the bike section saving as much energy as possible for the run. \n\nSocial cafe rides:\nOne of the most enjoyable aspects of being a road rider, for Matt at least, is the social side. And by that we mean going for a steady spin, either a recovery type ride post event or pre race taper type ride or simply just a longer run that involves stopping at a cafe for coffee and cake. A ride with no real pressure at all aside from enjoyment.\n\nCarrying spares:\nThe humble saddle bag: nice and neat, fits snugly under your saddle so is pretty aero and contains the spares youâ€™ll need for a training ride; spare tube, levers and a multi tool. Then, thereâ€™s the classic old school cut off bottle, another place to neatly and compactly put your spares, leaving room in your back pockets for food, rain capes.\n\nWhich of these do you think is the biggest lesson triathletes can learn?
