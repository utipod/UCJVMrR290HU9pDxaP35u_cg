title = "What Is The Best Sport To Start Triathlon From? | The GTN Show Ep. 13"
description = "This is the GTN Show, and this week we will be discussing whether runners make better triathletes or whether it's swimmers or cyclists, and there's a study in that proves that marathon running isn't as bad for our knees and our joints as we may think.\n\nWe're also gonna be checking out the results from Noosa Triathlon that happened over the weekend, checking out Strava's new global heat map, which is pretty cool, and also checking out which bikes the pros were riding at Kona.\n\nYeah, and I should probably explain what's happened to Heather. She hasn't cut her hair or grown stubble over the weekend. We are in fact joined by four time British Duathlon champion and former British Triathlon champion Mark Buckingham. Thank you for joining us.\n\nSo yeah, Mark is gonna be joining us for a few videos whilst Heather is away on holiday. And whilst your results speak for themselves, I'm sure you don't mind me mentioning that you're also Alistair and Jonny Brownlee's training partner.\n\nNext up, a little bit of research for you. Now, I've always been told that long distance running will only deteriorate my joints, but Dr. Reed Ferber, the Director of the Running Injury Clinic claims that marathon running actually improves our health, and most importantly, improves our joint health.\n\nYeah, well the study was quite interesting really. So, you've basically got a group of marathon runners and then check their bone health, joint health, and then revisit it about 20 to 30 years later, and actually found that in many cases, the bone health and joint health were better than non-runners.\n\nWe'd best enter that Ironman, then. Yeah, best get for a long run now. So, speaking of getting out and about more, what you want to do is check out Strava's new global heat map. It's pretty cool, you can basically see where everyone's running and riding around the world.\n\nYeah, I've probably spent a little bit longer than I'd like to admit on it. It's quite mesmerising, there's over a billion activities from over 10 million athletes, racking up over 200 thousand years worth of duration. Yeah, I mean you just spend hours looking at it. So, go check out your local town and set in your cool rides and see where everyone else is going as well.\n\nWell, I guess this is pretty relevant to you, Mark, being an ex elite runner before you turned to triathlon. This weekend, triathlete Sara Dossena from Italy placed sixth in the New York City marathon at a time of 2:29. Which is pretty impressive considering the British Olympic standard for the women's marathon is 2:31. So, it's well inside that, so that's a pretty phenomenal time for a triathlete.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3N\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/3M\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  What Is FTP? - http://gtn.io/FTP\nüìπ  10 Bucket List Triathlons - http://gtn.io/tribucketlist\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
