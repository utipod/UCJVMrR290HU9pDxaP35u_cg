description = "Matt Bottrill is a bit of a guru when it comes to time trialling and just cycling fast. We're going talk about optimising speed, power, aerodynamics and pacing to make you faster on the bike!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7H\n\nMatt seriously knows his stuff when it comes to time trialling, aerodynamics, and just going fast. He has coached Tim Don to the current Ironman record, Lucy Charles, Will Clarke, Susie Cheetham, and Rachel Joyce. Matt‚Äôs own accolades include a 10mile TT PB of 17"40 and he was the UK TT champion for the 10, 25, 50 and 100mile. And, just a couple of years ago he decided to give triathlon a go!\n\nThe body is 80% of your drag while you're riding, or while you're racing, so, the better aero position you can get in, as well as optimising power efficiency, then you are going to save some serious time. In 2014, Matt learnt a lot about aerodynamics losing 20 watts in power, but gaining 40 watts in aerodynamics resulting in massive improvements.\n\nAs shown, cycling fast is about much more than having strong legs. It involves looking at every element that's gonna make you go fast. The position on the bike, the training, you're just breaking everything down, trying to find all those one percents.\n\nIf you liked this video, don't forget to give it a thumbs up and share with your triathlon and cycling friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/7G\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Improve Your Triathlon Training | What Is FTP? - http://gtn.io/FTP\nüìπ What Is The Optimal Cycling Cadence For You To Run Faster Off The Bike? - http://gtn.io/OptimalCadence\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCar Chase Rock And Roll 1 - Victor Olsson\nTeenage Lullaby - Ooyy\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
