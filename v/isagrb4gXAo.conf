title = "Spinning Vs. Grinding | What Cadence Is Right For You?"
description = "Whether you're spinning a high cadence in a small gear, or grinding out of the saddle in the big ring, power is power, right? But is one cadence more efficient than another, and should we as triathletes change our cadence to stay better prepared for the run? We decided to ride up a climb in the 53x11 to show how different cadences affect us in different ways.\n____________________\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/Z6 \n\nWhat's your preferred cadence?
