description = "We're here in Kona ahead of the IRONMAN World Championship and we've got Kyle Buckingham's pro bike and kit. Now, Kyle is the current World Record holder for the IRONMAN age group Word Championships and that catapulted him onto the pro team, where he's become a two-times IRONMAN winner. This is The Look 796 RS which is a new frame and Kyle's only been riding it for a couple of weeks and it features the mono-blade technology which gives it that narrow, Aero profile. \n\nNow this bike had got quite a few Aero features. It has Aero front forks with an integrated front brake. Underneath the bottom bracket, you can see the rear brake down here. It's got lowered seats stays and it has it's own Aero seat post and it has a hidden seat post clamp. Moving forward, it has it's own Aeroflat Stem, which gives it a completely flat profile from the stem through to the top tube. Connected to that are the Aeroflat base bars and then on top of that you've got the Look carbon poles. \n\nHe's using the Look armrest so he's added extra thick pads on top and moving forward, he's got the Shimano Dura Ace Di2 shifters both on the ends of the poles and on his base bars and he's using Dura Ace brake lever. He's riding the Shimano Dura Ace Di2 electronic front and rear derailleurs with a 54x39 chain rings and 11x25 cassette. \n\nHe's using the Look Zed 3 monocoque Aero crank so he's riding at a 165 ml crank length. An interesting feature on these cranks is they're actually adjustable in length. Now Kyle is on the middle setting of 165 ml but you can actually move them down to 162.5 or up to 167.5. On the end on these cranks, he's using the Look Keo Power pedals. \n\nHe's using the Mavic Comete Pro Carbon SL tubular wheels and on those he's running the Mavic 25 ml tubular tyres. He's using the ISM PL1 saddle and then he's got the XLab bottle cages front and rear and on the front one, he's using the Profile Design Aero bottle. On the back here, he's got the XLab Gorilla Cage for added grip just to stop the bottles falling out. Finally, he's got the Garmin Edge 520 bike computer. \n\nCool, so Kyle, thanks for joining us. We've got a couple of questions we wanted to ask you. Starting off then with your trisuit. Now, I gather you're going to have a new one for race day. How's it going to differ?\n\nYeah, for race day, I've chosen the sleeveless. I just found when it's this hot and this humid, I just feel like you know, I just want a little more breatheability on my shoulders.\n\nAnd is white for the heat as well, or is that just the colour you like?\n\nIt's always the colour that I've liked, but yeah, it is a good option and the sleeveless also tested faster with me in the wind tunnel. We tried a couple of suits and the sleeveless suit suited me better.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/4k\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/4l\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  What Is The Optimal Cycling Cadence To Run Fast Off The Bike? - http://gtn.io/OptimalCadence \nüìπ  Susie Cheetham's Cervelo P5X - http://gtn.io/SCheethamP5X\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
