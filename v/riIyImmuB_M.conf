description = "The butterfly swimming stroke. Feared by many, the stroke that Michael Phelps made look easy - but it doesn‚Äôt need to be that hard! We break the stroke down step by step so you can add butterfly into your swim training, and become a faster and more efficient swimmer!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/zR\n\nButterfly is a tougher stroke to master compared to freestyle, backstroke or breaststroke, but, by doing a few key things well, you can quickly progress with it.\n\nButterfly is swum on your front, eyes facing down and forwards as in front crawl, however, there is no rotation, your body should be parallel to the bottom of the pool. Your head leads the movement of the stroke and the rest of your body should follow, causing the undulating dolphin movement.¬†\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/zQ\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Swim Freestyle üëâ https://gtn.io/FrontCrawl\nüìπ Swim with GTN Playlist üëâ https://gtn.io/SwimWithGTN\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nCold Brew - Dylan Sitts\nPriddy - Fasion\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
