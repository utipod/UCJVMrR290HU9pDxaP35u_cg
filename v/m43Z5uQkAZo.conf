title = "Sub 8 Hours In Kona -  Is It Impossible? | The Ironman World Championships"
description = "In professional Ironman racing, sub-8 hours is the gold standard time for male triathletes. The Ironman World Championships in Kona attracts the world's best athletes, however, this 8-hour barrier has never been broken. So, why is it almost impossible to go sub-8 hours on this course?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/eJ \n\nBefore we begin, here is a little history of the Kona records! Both the 11-hour and 10-hour barriers were smashed in 1980 in one go by Dave Scott with a time of 9:24. Then Scott got close to going sub-9 just three years later with 9:05 and convincingly broke the barrier in 1984 with a fast time of 8:54.\n\nThe times continued to fall at a rapid rate over the next few years as a result of the Dave Scott & Mark Allen battle. So much so that by 1989 the record dropped to 8:09. It was then the turn of a new generation of athletes with Luc Van Lierd taking it down to 8:04 on his first attempt at the course in 1996. It then wasn‚Äôt until 2011 that we saw a new record by Craig Alexander clocking 8:03. This stood as the record until 2017 when Germany‚Äôs Patrick Lange lowered it to 8:01:40 in near perfect Kona conditions.\n\nSo, why is it almost impossible to go sub-8 hours in Kona?\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/eI \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ 2018 Ironman World Championship In Numbers | Everything You Need To Know About Kona - http://gtn.io/KonaInNumbers\nüìπ How To Pace An Ironman Triathlon - http://gtn.io/IronmanPacing\n \nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
