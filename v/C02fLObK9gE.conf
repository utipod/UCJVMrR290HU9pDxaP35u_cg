Do it right and you can shave valuable seconds off your time!  \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/a8\n\nMark and Heather share their tips on how to nail the open water swim exit. \n\nTo improve your time in T1, swim until your fingertips touch the ground, then drive up with your knees.
