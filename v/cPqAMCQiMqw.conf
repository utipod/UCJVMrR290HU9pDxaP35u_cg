title = "Run Fast Off The Bike | GTN's Ultimate Tempo Brick Workout"
description = "Whether you're an old hand to triathlon, or a complete beginner, you've probably heard of the term brick session. So here we are at team bath. And we're about to do a run/bike/run. Nice solid brick. \n\nNot too hard. And what we're gonna do is cap it at 80% heart rate. Yep, I mean it is winter after all. We don't want to get ill, we don't want to get injured. So we're gonna work at a tempo pace.\n\nSo the first run's gonna be a mile around the track, which hopefully I'll get a little but of a head start on. 'Cause Mark will come back and catch me on the bike, no doubt. The bike's gonna be 10k long. And the last run. The second run is gonna be just two laps of the track, 800 metres.\n\nShould we get going? Let's get going, I'll get warmed up. Right. What Mark doesn't know, given that he is a professional at the moment, I'm going to be giving my heart rate monitor to the cameraman. So hopefully I get a bit of a head start on the first run. Let's go.\n\nAlright mate. So, are you ready? Yep.\n\nThe Polar is gonna beep if you go above 80% heart rate so no cheating. We'll be listening. Alright, here we go. A mile, let's go. See you're pushin' a bit harder, eh? Mine's beepin'. Who'd'a thought it?\n\nI ran that bang on 80%. He's fitter than I thought he was. Oh you absolute sod. I thought somethin' was up.\n\n6k in, what you? 7. \n\n9.88. 9.99. 10k. God. Elastic laces would've been much better. Prepare to fail. \n\nAlright mate. I'm just buzzing away. You can't win 'em all. Make sure you're not working too hard there, mate. \n\nGood job. I heard you beeping like a lap ago. I think it was for the whole two laps.\n\nSo, here we are back in the studio, after the brick session. It was quite a tough brick session as well. It was. It was the first one of the winter, you've got to dust off the cobwebs a bit and...\n\nI think it's more that, it probably shouldn't have been that tough, but clever tactic by Mark to take his heart rate monitor off and give it to the camera man.\n\nWell, you are a bit fitter than me so I had to have a little bit of a handicap. Well no, it was all good. Congratulations for your second place.\n\nSo, why do a brick session? \n\nWell I think it's important to do these things 'cause it's, you know, we're multi-sport athletes and it's a multi-sport training session. You jump in from one discipline to the other. You gettin' those jelly legs like you do in a race. I think it's just good practise to delve back into that every now and again.\n\nAbsolutely, and especially coming from a swim to a bike or a swim to a run. You have that shunt of blood from down to your legs and you can only mimic that by doing it in training as you would in a race.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/4b\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/4c\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  What Is The Optimal Cycling Cadence To Run Off The Bike Fast? - http://gtn.io/OptimalCadence\nüìπ  GTN's Lamp Post Interval Session - http://gtn.io/RunInterval\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
