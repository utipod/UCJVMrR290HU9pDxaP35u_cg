title = "GTN Unboxing: NEW Polar Vantage Multisport Watches"
description = "It's the NEW Polar Vantage multisport watches! With optical heart rate and running power, these GPS watches are a big addition to the Polar range.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/dH \n\nIn association with Polar.\n\nENTER HERE - http://gtn.io/WINPolarVantage\n\nIn this video, Mark unboxes the Polar Vantage M and Vantage V watches. The Vantage V is the big brother/sister and has some seriously cool features!\n\nThe big feature in the Vantage V is the running power meter. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs first running power meter that works from the wrist! This means there is no need for an external device to record power whilst you run. Polar bring together several running metrics into one, easy-to-understand number that represents the power that the runner is producing. It‚Äôs still a relatively new and unexplored territory by a lot of runners and triathletes, but it will certainly be interesting to see how our power changes between different speeds, or maybe when we have jelly legs coming off the bike!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/dG\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Inside The Polar Factory - The History Of Heart Rate Monitors - http://gtn.io/PolarFactory\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n200 Dont's (Instrumental Version) STEMS DRUMS - Sebastian Forslund\nCasino Slot Machine 4 - SFX Producer\nChoir Hymn - Magnus Ringblom\nOut Of Her Mind STEMS DRUMS - Sebastian Forslund\nSmoozie - [ocean jams]\nTuxedo - Tigerblood Jewel\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
