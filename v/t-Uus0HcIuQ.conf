title = "Tom Bishop's Kuota Kougar Pro Bike And Kit"
description = "We're here with Tom Bishop's Kuota Kougar and his triathlon race gear ahead of the ITU grand final in Rotterdam. And it's a rather wet and windy Rotterdam as we've had to duck inside. But it will be really interesting to see if he's made any changes because of the conditions. \n\nSo the Kougar is an aero bike. So it's got a few aero touches. You've got the breaks hidden behind the forks and under the bottom bracket. And then we've got a hidden seat clamp bolt. \n\nLooking at Tom's wheel set choice, he's using the Mavic Cosmic Pro SL Wheels, which have a 40 mm rim depth. And to go with those he is using the Continental GP Supersonic Tyres. And interestingly he is using just a 23 mm tyre width. And because of the conditions out here and the technical course, he is running just 70 psi on the front and 80 on the rear. \n\nHe's using the Shimano Dura Ace 9100 11 speed group set, which is mechanical. And talking to Tom he prefers his mechanical rather than electronic just because he doesn't always travel with a mechanic. So if he has any issues or he wants to make any changes, he can quite easily do that with the mechanical system. \n\nHe's running the rotor 3D crank sets, with a 165 crank clank. And on the end of those he has got the speed plate pedals. And on his Rotor crank set he has the NOQ Rotor chain rings with 53/38 on the front and on the back, he's using an Ultegra cassette 11-25. And connecting the two he's using the gold KMC chain. \n\nSo we've got the Kuota aero seat post. And on top of that we have the San Marco Concord Saddle, which he's actually got set quite far forward in a nice aggressive position. And interestingly, underneath he has a gel stored here. And talking to Tom he actually stores one under the saddle and then one at the front of the bike. But that's a really cool storage place. I like it. \n\nOn the front end of the bike we've got the Deda Zero 100 stand, which is 110 mil. And attached to that we have the Deda Zero 100 handlebars and on those we have the Shimano Dura Ace 9100 mechanical levers. And then we have his Garmin mount which is at quite a jaunty angle. I thought it was just to be cool, but chatting to Tom, he believes it's more aero-dynamic. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3j\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/3k\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Draft Legal Triathlon Explainer - http://gtn.io/DraftLegal\nüìπ  How To Swim Fast Around Buoys - http://gtn.io/SwimBuoys\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
