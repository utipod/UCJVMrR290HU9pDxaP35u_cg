title = "Are Morning People Better Triathletes? | The GTN Show Ep. 40"
description = "We are back from Mallorca and on the show this week, we‚Äôre going to be discussing the pros and cons of being morning, or an evening, person with respect to triathlon training. We also look at some exciting triathlon products, race results from around the world and an exciting giveaway from Park Tool.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/9Q\n\nWin with Park Tool: http://gtn.io/WinParkTool\n\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nWe have been looking at an article about the relationship between circadian preference and sport. In other words whether we‚Äôre a morning person or a night owl. And basically, people have found that we tend to choose sports with training times that suit our own circadian preference. Triathlon generally falls in the category of 'morning person'. We‚Äôre trying to juggle three sports, so naturally that‚Äôs going to require some early starts. Are we actually all 'morning people'? And are 'morning people' better triathletes?\n\nHorne-Ostberg Questionnaire: http://www.cet-surveys.com/index.php\n\nIn episode 40 of the GTN Show we also discuss:\n- The HJC Prototype Aero Helmet\n- Road Grand Tours virtual training\n- The new Stealth vegan recovery drink\n- Drafting during Ironman Texas\n- The Polar promotion winners!\n- Results from IRONMAN 70.3 Pays d'Aix, IRONMAN 70.3 Vietnam and WTS Yokohama\n- And much more!\n\nAs well as the latest in all things triathlon, we have our usual segments such as the #GTNPainCave, #GTNTRIBE and CAPtion competition.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/9P\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Socks Vs No Socks - http://gtn.io/SocksVsNoSocks\nüìπ Marko Albert's Trek Speed Concept Triathlon Pro Bike - http://gtn.io/MarkoAlbertProBike\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
