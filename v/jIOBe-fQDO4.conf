title = "GTN Goes Anti-Aero | Tri-Bike Sabotage"
description = "GTN's latest edition, James Cunnama is too fresh out of the elite ranks, having the fitness to push some lofty numbers, whilst also talking to the camera a the same time! If he's not careful he's going to start making Mark and Heather look bad! Let's do something to slow him down a touch, we're going anti-aero. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/Uz\n\nFor this challenge, the guys were provided with a series of items to make each other's bikes slower, some of them a little more obvious than others! Obviously, we wouldn't recommend doing this to either your own or a friends bike without their own prior knowledge! But, if they're keen on a challenge, why not see how much slower you can make each other!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Check out Kim Morrison's Scott Plasma 6: https://gtn.io/KMScottPlasma6\nüìπ  Give yourself the best start in the swim: https://gtn.io/SwimStart\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nSad Clowns - Alexandra Woodward\nOne Less Reason - Rockin' For Decades\nWe Got the Balls - Rockin' For Decades\nCherry Bomb Lips - Carvings\nSmartface - Smartface\nOld Grump - Smartface\nRenowned - Alexandra Woodward\nWild Caravan - Alysha Sheldon\nBalkan Wishes - Trabant 33\nBalkan Traffic - Stationary Sign\nBalkan Parade - Stationary Sign\nBack in Balkan - Trabant 33\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
