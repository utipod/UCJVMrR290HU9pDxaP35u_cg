title = "$10 Million: Is There Enough Prize Money In Triathlon? | The GTN Show Ep. 28"
description = "This week weâ€™re talking pro triathlon prize money, morals within the sport, and the rather exciting weekend of racing! Weâ€™re also going to be discussing high-vis running clothing with a difference, a new triathlon bike from Factor, and a triathlon you can do on your sofa.\n\nDon't forget the GTN Show is for every triathlete, swimmer, cyclist and runner!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7m\n\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nOur main discussion this week is the size of the prize purse in pro triathlon races around the world. Thorsten Radde from TriRating.com has put together some interesting analysis of the prize money lists from last year. Here are a few of the trends he noticed from the 2017 season:\n- Ironman's full-distance events handed out a total of US$2,676.750, which was down 1.8 percent from 2016.\n- Ironman 70.3 races, where US$2,363,000 was handed out, was down 9.8 percent from 2016.\n- Challenge-Family full- and half-distance races there was US$1,083,472 in prizes, up 22 percent from 2016.\nIf you add all the prize money in pro triathlon together, the total is about $10 million dollars! Do you think this is enough? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below ðŸ‘‡\n\nAlso on the show this week, we discuss:\n- Vollebak's Black Light range of black high visibility clothing.\n- A new triathlon specific version of the Factor Slick.\n- A triathlon board game.\n- Ironman's 40th Birthday.\n- Race results from Ironman 70.3 Geelong, Challenge Wanaka, The Big Husky triathlon and the Paratriathlon World Cup in Australia.\n\nIn last weeks poll, we asked you whether you would rather be too hot or too cold when training and racing. It was a close one however, being too hot came out on top with 56% of your votes!  This week, we want to know if you put your shoes on in T1 or do you attach them to the bike?\n\nAs well as the latest in all things triathlon, we have our usual segments such as the #GTNPainCave, #GTNTRIBE and CAPtion competition.\n\nWe hope you enjoy episode 28 of the GTN Show, let us know your thoughts about triathlon prize money in the comments below ðŸ‘‡\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/7l\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nðŸ“¹ GTN's Tempo Run Training Guide | Everything You Need To Know - http://gtn.io/TempoRun\nðŸ“¹ Improve Your Open Water Confidence | 8 Beginner Swimming Tips - http://gtn.io/OpenWaterConfidence\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers â€“ and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, weâ€™re here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTubeâ€™s best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
