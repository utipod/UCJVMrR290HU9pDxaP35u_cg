description = "Your optimum run cadence is a hot topic. Elite athletes run with a much higher cadence than amateur triathletes. Is this better for your running? How many strides should you take per minute? And should this number change during a triathlon? \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/f-\n\nWhether you‚Äôre new to running, or an old hand at it; I‚Äôm sure someone has mentioned the importance of cadence to you. Simply, this is the number of steps you take per minute - and it seems to be a topic for debate!\n\nA large proportion of amateur athletes have a slow running cadence, taking fewer steps per minute. But, the research suggests that if we want to run faster then we should be striving to run with a higher cadence, and therefore taking more steps per minute.\n\nHowever, within triathlon, we‚Äôre running on fatigued legs having already swum and cycled already. It‚Äôs a very different game to just running fresh on fresh legs so, today, we are going to be taking a look at the best running cadence for a triathlon.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/fZ \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ What Is The Optimal Cycling Cadence For You To Run Faster Off The Bike? | GTN Does Science - http://gtn.io/cadencerunning \nüìπ How To Improve Your Run Cadence | Triathlon Running Tips - http://gtn.io/RunCadence\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nLay Low - Dylan Sitts\nOblique - Dylan Sitts\nSpaced - [ocean jams]\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
