title = "How Fast Can You Make Amateur Triathletes? | The Specialized Zwift Academy Triathlon Team"
description = "GTN head to California to meet the amateur triathletes looking to make their mark in the triathlon world by racing at the Ironman World Championships. With the help of Zwift, Specialized and Tim Don, these athletes have every chance of making it to Kona!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/cB\n\nIn association with Zwift.\n\nThis was a three day training camp and the first time the winners of the Specialized Zwift Academy Tri Team had ever got together. With the help of Specialized, these age groupers would be getting new kit, new bikes and even wind tunnel testing in preparation for them all attempting to qualify for the Ironman World Champs in Kona 2018.\n\nThe finale for this project, Zwift hope, is to have all the athletes competing at Kona for their age group. For Bex and Rachael who have already qualified, this reality is getting ever closer and both potentially have a chance at topping their age-groups on the big island in Hawaii. For Geert and Golo, the challenge of qualifying is still very real.\n\nEven with this help, they still have other commitments, families, and jobs to contend with. So, just how far can you help and push a bunch of very good amateur triathletes?\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/cA\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Indoor Cycling Kit Choice | What To Wear On The Turbo Trainer - http://gtn.io/WearOnTheTurbo\nüìπ How To Choose An Indoor Trainer | Which Wahoo Trainer Is Right For You? - http://gtn.io/ChooseATrainer\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nAfter The Rain - Silver Maple\nBeat Me 1 (Sting) - Jonatan JaÃàrpehag\nBigtooth Aspen - Martin Gauffin\nCoffee And Unicorns - Henyao\nColored Spirals 5 - Johannes BornloÃàf\nFuzzy Logic - Nihoni\nIsla Del Sol - Henyao\nLove For The Ocean (Tigerblood Jewel Remix) (Instrumental Version) STEMS DRUMS - Martin Hall\nMarches STEMS BASS - Tigerblood Jewel\nMarches STEMS DRUMS - Tigerblood Jewel\nNativitas - Anders Schill Paulsen\nReverberations 5 - Johannes BornloÃàf\nScratch Boom Bang - Anders Ekengren.mp3\nSurf's Up! 3 - Jonas Elander\nTake This Chance - Henyao\nThe Big Transformation - August Wilhelmsson\nThe Infinite Dreamer - Chill Cole\nTwin Tales - LUCHS\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
