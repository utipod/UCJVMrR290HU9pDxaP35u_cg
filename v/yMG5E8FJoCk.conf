description = "Sometimes you need to take it easy! This might sound strange when you are training for your next triathlon but the recovery workout should not be underestimated.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/iK \n\nIn association with TrainingPeaks.\n\nThe importance of recovery can not be emphasised enough. In order to improve, you need to stress your body with training and then let it recover as this is when it adapts and gets stronger (known as super-compensation). \n\nWe have covered various approaches, the importance of rest and good nutrition in aiding your recovery but sometimes, light training is the answer. Some of your swim, bike & run training sessions should come under the 'active recovery' umbrella.
