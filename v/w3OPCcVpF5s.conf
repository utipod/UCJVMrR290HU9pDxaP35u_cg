title = "Unboxing The Orca RS1 Swimskin | Triathlon & Open Water Swimming Kit"
description = "If you you want to swim faster, swim more easily and look more pro, this one is for you! Mark unboxes and checks out the brand new RS1 swimskin from Orca. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/c9\n\nIn association with Orca.\n\nENTER HERE - http://gtn.io/OrcaWIN\n\nA swimskin comes in use for non-wetsuit legal swims. Whilst it might be hard to imagine for some parts of the world, the water does actually get warm enough in places for wetsuits to be made illegal in swims. Believe it or not, it does happen. Take the Ironman World Championships in Hawaii for example, that has always been non-wetsuit and many athletes resort to wearing a swimskin over their trisuit.\n\nThe Orca RS1 is hydrophobic - meaning it repels water. That has been achieved with Orca‚Äôs HydroSkin Dry water-repellent coating, which they say has an absorption coefficient of 0% after 3hrs. So this suit repels water all day long if 3 hour plus swims are your sort of thing! It also does mean that this suit is going to last some good use. \n\nWhilst you don‚Äôt get the same lift in the water that you do from wearing a wetsuit, Orca do say that the reduced water absorption does add to buoyancy compared to just wearing a trisuit.\n\nMost importantly, we have 4 of them to giveaway; 2 men‚Äôs, and 2 women‚Äôs, in your choice of size.
