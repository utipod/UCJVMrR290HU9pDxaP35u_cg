description = "There is one workout that any endurance runner or triathlete should be doing, and it‚Äôs the tempo run! There is a good reason for this, you get the biggest training gains from your time. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7e\n\nTo explain what a tempo run is we, need to get a little sciency. Lactate Threshold is the point where you produce too much lactic acid for your body to flush it away effectively. If you run too fast and go over this point you will start slow down. So, when we talk about ‚Äòtempo‚Äô, we‚Äôre meaning a pace that is at or near to our lactate threshold. The idea of this, is that running at this pace will gradually bump our threshold up.\n\nSimply put, we‚Äôre aiming at a pace that is comfortably hard to start with, but over time it will start to bite. In real terms this is the maximum pace you can sustain for around an hour. A good alternative to an hour long run TT is to work out your 10km pace and add around 10-20 seconds per kilometre. If you‚Äôre working by heart rate; it‚Äôs roughly 80-90% of your maximum HR. And, on a perceived effort scale of 1-10, it‚Äôs about a 7 out of 10.\n\nIn terms of the structure of the session, the intervals tend to be quite long. So today, Mark and Lawrence are doing 2 x 15 minutes at tempo, with 2mins jog recovery between. You can do a tempo run wherever you like, but in our experience it‚Äôs a session that you want to dial in to your pace with, so a route and terrain that allows you to crack on without disruptions is best. \n\nIf you found this video useful, don't forget to give it a thumbs up and share with your triathlon and running friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/7d\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Run On The Track | Everything You Need To Know - http://gtn.io/RunTrack\nüìπ How To Run A Fast 5k With GCN's Dan Lloyd - http://gtn.io/Fast5k\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
