title = "How To Swim With A Pull Buoy | Improve Your Freestyle Swimming"
description = "The pull buoy is a swim aid designed to help isolate your arms and provide support to your body without having to kick. This allows you to focus on developing your freestyle technique and strength in the water.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/i1 \n\nIn this video, Mark & Fraser explain why you might want to use a pull buoy and then how to incorporate this into your training. If you are relatively new to pull work, then you may want to start with fairly short reps in your workout. That way you can focus on the quality of each rep, with a short break to recover between each\n\nA simple example would be completing 12x25m pull, with 20s recovery between each rep. Once you feel comfortable doing this, you can then build to something like 8x50m, then to 4x100m.\n\nHow often do you include pull work in your training?
