description = "We're here in Hawaii with BMC Etixx team member, Ronnie Schildknecht's, BMC Time Machine. \n\nThis bike has a very sleek, clean looking frame. And several aero features, including this container here that sits behind the seat post, where Ronnie keeps his punch row packets. \n\nMoving forwards, he's got the integrated stem, which gives a nice flat aero profile. And then, attached to that, the aero BMC base bars. And on top, he's got the new Drag2Zero aero poles. Ronnie's using profile design arm cuffs and to change gear, he's using the Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 shifters on the end of his poles and on his base bars. \n\nHe's got the new full Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 group set. And he's riding 54/42 chain rings and 11/28 cassette with a crank length of 172.5 mil. And on the end of that, he's got Dura-Ace pedals. And for power, he's using the Stages Crank Base Power Metre. \n\nOn to the wheels, Ronnie is running the Dura-Ace C60 on front and back. And on those, he's got the Vittoria core set 25mm tyres, which is gonna be running at 7.5 bar. \n\nAnd for the finishing touches, Ronnie is using the Fizik Arione saddle and then behind that, he's got the Xlab Gorilla bottle cage. And also on the down tube he's using the Tacx bottle cage. And then, up front, he's got the Polar M460 computer, where he'll be reading his power. Ronnie's bike weighs in at around 9 kilos. And now for the free hub sound. \n\nMoving on to Ronnie's race kit, he's gonna be using the Compress Sport Tri Suit. And he's using the Uvex Race-8 Time Trial helmet. And finally, he's gonna be running in the Soucony Breakthru 2 running shoes.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/4R\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/4S\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  8 Training Tips Every Triathlete Should Master - http://gtn.io/8TrainingTips\nüìπ  Cyril Viennot's Scott Plasma Pro Bike And Triathlon Kit - http://gtn.io/CVScottPlasma\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
