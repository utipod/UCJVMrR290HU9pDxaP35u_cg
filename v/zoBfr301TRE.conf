title = "How To Pace An Ironman Triathlon"
description = "Triathlon is an endurance sport, so it requires an element of pacing. But an Ironman, or a Long Distance triathlon, is another level - it‚Äôs vital you get you‚Äôre pacing right!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/cz\n\nYour swim in an Ironman should be done at a relatively steady and aerobic pace. This is stage one, before a rather long day, so you don‚Äôt want to be burning any matches at this point by going too hard and into the red.If we use a Perceived Effort of Exertion scale from 1-10; 1 being easy, and 10 being hard. An Ironman swim should sit somewhere in the middle, around the 5 out of 10. \n\nThe best advice Mark has heard is to treat the bike leg like a training day. Try not to get carried away with the idea of it being a ‚Äòrace‚Äô. And if at any point you feel a burn from lactate, then you should definitely, definitely back off! A power meter is a really useful and instantly reactive measurement of how hard you‚Äôre working. If you do have a power meter already, then we recommend completing a 20min Function Threshold Power test, or FTP test for short. Using the result from this you should pace your Ironman bike leg between 65-80% of your FTP depending on how fast you want to go.\n\nYou should start your Ironman run at around 65-70% of your maximum heart rate. This is quite low, but this will get you through the first half-marathon comfortably. If you feel ok beyond that point, then you can begin to gradually build the pace over the second half. A good tip I picked up from Jan Frodeno, previous Ironman World Champ, was to take your time through the aid stations. Not only is it a time to fuel up and hydrate, it‚Äôs also a time for you to compose yourself and break the race up mentally. \n\nFor more information on all this, listen to Mark explain the full details and let us know how you would pace an Ironman race in the comments below!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/cy\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Improve Your Triathlon Training | What Is FTP? - http://gtn.io/FTP\nüìπ Triathlon Training Explained | What Is Critical Swim Speed? - http://gtn.io/TTECritcalSwim\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCastle To Ruin STEMS DRUMS - Martin Hall\nConsequenses (Instrumental Version) STEMS DRUMS - Johan Svensson\nMajesty 5 STEMS DRUMS - Marc Torch\nNevermore 1 STEMS DRUMS - Marc Torch\nUplifter STEMS DRUMS - Sebastian Forslund\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
