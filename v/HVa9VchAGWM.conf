title = "The Worst Temperature For Triathlon? | The GTN Show Ep. 27"
description = "On this week's GTN Show, we discuss evidence that running is good for your joints, world number 1 tennis star trying out triathlon, and the release of Zwift running. As its the Winter Olympics, we look at how these athletes prepare and cope with the cold!\n\nDon't forget the GTN Show is for every triathlete, swimmer, cyclist and runner!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/77\n\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nOur main discussion in the show this week is the COLD! With the Winter Olympics currently in full swing, we look at how athletes can prepare and cope with these extreme temperatures. We're unlikely to experience these lows in triathlon but adaptation to the cold environments is an incredibly slow process. On the topic of cold, we also look at the challenge set by Diego Lopez... do you think you could complete an ice mile swim? \n\nIn last weeks poll, we asked you what is the worst thing about triathlon. To Mark's surprise, 15% of you said that rest days are the worst. However, 'All the equipment' came out on top with 39% of your votes! This week, we ask you whether you would rather be too hot or too cold when competing?\n\nAlso on the show this week, we discuss:\n- Tennis World #1 Caroline Wozniacki has revealed she is planning on taking up triathlon.\n- The release of Zwift runnning.\n- Marathon running being good for your knees.\n- ITU Cape Town Triathlon World Cup.\n- Gwen Jorgensen's new 5k PB of 15:15:64.\n- Coast To Coast race in New Zealand.\n\nAs well as the latest in all things triathlon, we have our usual segments such as the #GTNPainCave, #GTNTRIBE and CAPtion competition.\n\nWe hope you enjoy episode 27 of the GTN Show, let us know what you think is the worst thing about triathlon in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/78\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Triathlon Training Plan | Kickstart Your Triathlon Training | Week 1-2 - http://gtn.io/FirstTriWeek1-2\nüìπ Comfort Vs.
