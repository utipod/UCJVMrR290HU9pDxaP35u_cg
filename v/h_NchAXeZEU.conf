title = "Threshold Training With GTN | Indoor, High Intensity Interval Workout"
description = "This HIIT style workout is designed to increase your maximal power and in turn, your threshold power. This indoor workout includes high intensity intervals, followed by threshold efforts, and then back to high intensity intervals. Work hard, and ride along with Mark on the Ironman World Championships Kona course.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/6j\n\nPDF Copy of Workout: http://gtn.io/IntervalWorkoutPDF\nFIT File for Workout: http://gtn.io/IntervalWorkoutFIT\n\nFormer pro triathlete, Mark Threlfall, takes you through GTN's high intensity interval workout. This workout is based on the iconic Ironman World Championships bike course out in Kona. Specifically, ride with him back towards Kona after the Hawi turnaround point.\n\nMark is riding this session on the Wahoo Kickr and the new Wahoo Kickr Climb trainers to really simulate the hills and undulations on this iconic course. We would like to thank partners of the channel, Wahoo, for the products used in this video.\n\nThe main set is a 20 interval workout that you can do throughout the year, both during the winter off-season and the race season. The session starts with tabata intervals, which involves 20 seconds maximal effort followed directly by a short 10 second recovery. After 2 minutes recovery, you hit several 2 minute threshold efforts to be done at 100% of your FTP. To wrap up the session, Mark takes you back through 3 minutes of tabata intervals.\n\nBefore starting the set, there is a 5 minute warm up and the session will also conclude with a 5 minute cool down on this impressive Kona course.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, and would like to see more, let us know in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/6k\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Strength Training With GTN | Indoor Hill Training On The Ironman World Champs Course - http://gtn.io/IndoorStrengthWorkout\nüìπ  Running Workout ‚Äì Train Anywhere With GTN's 40 Minute Lamp Post Intervals - http://gtn.io/RunInterval\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
