title = "The Best Fitness Test? 20 Minute FTP Vs Ramp | Cycling Training For Triathlon"
description = "Having an accurate functional threshold power is an important metric for training and racing on the bike, but just how exactly do you calculate it? If you're lucky enough to have a power meter on your bike or turbo trainer you can perform a few common tests. In this video Heather and Mark both do a 20 minute FTP test and a ramp test to compare their power numbers and determine which they prefer. Mark also speaks to Dr Stephen Faulkner, a celebrated exercise physiologist for more information. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gcn.eu/58B\n\nWhich would you prefer to do? \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. 👍\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nWatch more on GTN...\n📹  Run Pacing | https://gcn.eu/58A\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nES_A Morning in Hindsight - Nebulae \nES_Bermuda - Ooyy\nES_Calling Me - Ooyy\nES_Crushing Waves - Marc Torch\nES_Gray Matter - Smartface\nES_Thunderbird - Ooyy\nES_VHS Hero - Lofive\nES_Watcher - Brendon Moeller\nES_You Thought I Knew (Instrumental Version) - Particle House\n\nPhotos: © Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
