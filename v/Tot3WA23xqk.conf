title = "How To Do A Beach Start In A Triathlon"
description = "Triathlons start in a number of different ways, from pontoons to treading water, but the one that worries most people is the beach start. With Mark and Heather's tips though, you'll soon be nailing the beach start!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/8O\n\nBefore your event begins make sure you have a recce of the conditions underfoot with your beach start, check whether there are any rocks to look out for or if the beach suddenly drops away for example.\n\nWhen you run into the water, keep your knees high and flick your feet out to the side. This might look a bit silly, but it is the fastest way to run in the water as it stops your feet dragging in the water as it gets deeper. \n\nTry and run until the water gets above your knees, but if your feet drag in the water and trip you up, just style it out and dive anyway. Just make sure you keep your dive nice and shallow, or you could end up with a mouthful of sand üòÇ\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/8P\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nOpen water skills in the pool http://gtn.io/OWSkillsPool üìπ \nOpen water confidence http://gtn.io/OpenWaterConfidence üìπ \n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
