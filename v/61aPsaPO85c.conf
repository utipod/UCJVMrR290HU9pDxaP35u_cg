title = "Gear Ratios Explained For Triathlon | Choosing The Right Cassette, Chainrings & Shifters"
description = "The gearing you have on your bike is such an important factor when it comes to improving your performance and your enjoyment, yet it‚Äôs possibly one of the most commonly forgotten things. So, let‚Äôs take a look at the gearing you should choose for a triathlon?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/6L\n\nIn association with Shimano.\n\nGears really do have a huge impact on our riding. Gears that are too low, or too easy, may leave you spinning out, wishing you had a couple of harder gears. Whilst, gears that are too high, may bring you to a grinding halt on a steep climb. \n\nFirstly you have the chainset. Simply put the lower the number of teeth on the chainrings the easier the gear. So, there are a few common options with these. There is the standard, with a 53t outer ring, and a 39t inner ring. You also have the semi-compact, that has slightly easier gears, with a 52t outer ring, and a 36t inner ring. Then you have the compact, that is even easier again, with a 50t outer ring, and 34t inner ring.\n\nThe other area you can customise your gear ratios is with your cassette. It sort of allows you to fine tune and optimise your gear selection and you‚Äôre not short of options either. Shimano cassettes come in a number of ratios including 11-25T, 11-28T, 11-30T, 11-32T, 12-25T, 14-28T! Whereas a larger number on the chainset means harder gears, on the cassette a larger number actually means easier gears. So, for example, I have quite a nice range on my bike as it goes from 11 teeth on the smallest sprocket, up to 30 teeth on the largest. So, it‚Äôs very well suited to a hilly terrain because I have a range up to 30 teeth.\n\nThere are so many options when it comes to gear ratios but we hope this video helped you to understand what is available.
