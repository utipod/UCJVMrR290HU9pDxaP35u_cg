So, what are the signs that we compete in triathlons? \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/8G\n\nAt GTN, we understand that from the outside world, triathletes can seem a little odd! With 3 sports, there is a lot to think about when it comes to training, kit and our general behaviour. Here are 12 things that we think make us stand out from the crowd:\n\n- You panic when you have to travel out of town because you don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôll swim\n- You are completely obsessed with being more aerodynamic\n- Your appetite is larger than anyone else you know\n- Urinating on yourself has become completely appropriate\n- You‚Äôre jealous of your friends who are ‚Äújust‚Äù training for a marathon\n- You consider work, recovery time between training sessions\n- Your legs are smoother than your partners\n- You spend your 2-week annual holiday at a training camp\n- You know you‚Äôre a triathlete when your car purchase depends on whether your bike will fit in the back\n- Your cologne of choice is chlorine\n- You‚Äôre handbag has become a rucksack full of emergency training kit\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, don't forget to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/8F\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Beginner Triathlon Mistakes - http://gtn.io/TriathlonMistakes\nüìπ The 7 Unwritten Rules Of Triathlon - http://gtn.io/7UnwrittenRules\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
