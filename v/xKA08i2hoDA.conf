Here is GTN's advice on how to master cornering swim buoys in the open water!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/1B\n\nSwimming around buoys can feel quite alien and can be very hectic on race day. Mark and Heather show you how to swim around a buoy and with practise you can master this skill with confidence.\n\nBegin with, break this skill down into 5 stages:\n- Sight on approach - make sure you are sighting and swim on the most direct route to the buoy, aiming for the side of it.\n- Take the fastest line - approach the buoy as close as possible without catching your arms and without cutting up other swimmers as a collision can slow you down significantly.\n- Enter the turn - maintain or increase your arm rate to get past the buoy quickly and get back into your rhythm. Keep your head down during the turn to maintain your speed.\n- Maintain leg kick - keep kicking to avoid your feet being swum over and pushed down as it is difficult to get back up to speed.\n- Sight on exit - as soon as you exit the turn, begin sighting for the next buoy swim to maintain on course.\n\nTry out these tips and let us know how you get on in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/1A\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  9 Open Water Swimming Skills - http://gtn.io/OpenWater\nüìπ  9 Essential Triathlon Skills To Master - http://gtn.io/9TriSkills\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
