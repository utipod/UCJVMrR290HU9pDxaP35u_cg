title = "The Pull - How To Swim Front Crawl | Freestyle Swimming Technique"
description = "The pull phase of the front crawl stroke is the propulsive phase - when the hand and arm are pulling against the water. Get this part of the stroke right, and you can considerably transform your technique; making it both easier and quicker.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/fR \n\nAfter entering our hand into the water first, we should aim to catch by applying pressure down onto the water. This maintains our body position in the water and begins to load the arms ready for the pull phase. \n\nWith a perfect catch, you should see the elbow above the hand as the hands presses down and through the water. As the hand starts to come underneath your head, then this is the start of the PULL PHASE.\n\nThere are different teachings on this pull phase, but the one that I recommend for symmetry, balance and efficiency - is a direct pull straight underneath the body. This prevents any movement or snaking from side-to-side. \n\nTo do this effectively, you should have a slight bend in the elbow. Somewhere between 90-120 degrees. As demonstrated earlier, this really allows maximum force production. \n\nIf you‚Äôre in a pool with a line on the bottom, as I am now...and you are fortunate enough to have a lane to yourself, or you‚Äôre in a squad session...then you can use this line to help teach this movement. Imagine the line is a ladder, and you have to pull yourself up this ladder. Each hand entry and pull should track over this line.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/fQ \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Rotation - How To Swim Front Crawl | Freestyle Swimming Technique - http://gtn.io/FrontCrawlRotate\nüìπ The Catch - How To Swim Front Crawl | Freestyle Swimming Technique - http://gtn.io/FrontCrawlCatch\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nMuy Loca - Beiba\nJust Wanna Run (Hallman Remix) (Instrumental Version) - Sebastian Forslund\nBeats And RnB 6 - Merlean\nBeats And RnB 5 - Merlean\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
