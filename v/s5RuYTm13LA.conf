description = "Changing your pedals made easy! Replacing, swapping to another bike, or travelling are the main reasons you may need to change your pedals. GTN's How To, makes removing and installing pedals a simple task!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/2B\n\nDepending on the type of pedals you have you will need either:\n- A specific pedal wrench or spanner\n- A large Allen Key\n\nThis simple task can be very confusing due to each pedal having a different thread. The right hand pedal follows the lefty-loosey righty-tighty rule and the left hand pedal has a reverse thread. This is to ensure the pedal does not come loose when cycling.\n\nFollow Mark's step by step guide to remove and install your pedals successfully - just be careful of your knuckles on the chainring!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/2C\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Repair A Race Day Puncture - http://gtn.io/PunctureRepair \nüìπ  How To Improve Your Run Cadence - http://gtn.io/RunCadence\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
