title = "The Catch - How To Swim Front Crawl | Freestyle Swimming Technique"
description = "Swimming fast is a combination of fitness and technique, one is about physical hard work the other more mental. We are going to be looking into the catch part of front crawl and showing how you can improve this important part of the stroke. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/cb\n\nYou can break the front crawl stroke into phases, the catch, the pull, the exit and the recovery. The stroke starts with the catch where your hand enters the water, the pull is the main underwater phase, the exit is as sounds, when your hand and arm come out of the water then the recovery is your arm coming over the surface of the water and back past your head.\n\nWithout a good catch the rest of the stroke is going to struggle, getting hold of the water at the front of the stroke is vital for a strong pull. But what exactly is this part of the swim stroke we are talking about.\n\nThe catch is when your hand enters the water at the front of the stroke; when your movement changes from moving forwards to pulling back and down under your body. The moment when your hand and forearm start to make this new movement is the catch, in theory you are ‚Äúcatching‚Äù this new body of water.\n\nThere are lots of drills you can do to help improve the catch phase of your stroke and these include:\n- Front scull\n- Single arm drill\n- Fist swimming\n- Scull starts\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/ca\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ 5 Swim Toys To Help Improve Your Technique | Swimming Tips For Beginners - http://gtn.io/5SwimToys \n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nDrive In At Midnight 5 - Gunnar Johns√©n\nBoogieland 7 - Stefan Netsman\nContours - Brendon Moeller\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
