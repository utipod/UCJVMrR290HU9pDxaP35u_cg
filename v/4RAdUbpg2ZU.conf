description = "We're in Hawaii with Michelle Vestarby's Huffy Panama Jack town bike, complete with its own bottle opener and basket for all your nutritional needs. But, actually, we're here to see Michelle's race bike. And this is her Cannondale Super Slice time trial bike. \n\nWe're gonna start with the frame and this absolutely awesome paint work. So, Michelle's had this designed and painted for her by a friend back in Denmark. I have to say, I've never seen anything like this and I'm incredibly jealous. \n\nWell, let's move to the groups here, which is pretty pimped out. She's got the sram red ETAP front and rear derailleurs. She's got the ceramic speed oversize jockey wheels and the UFA chain. She's using the 55/42 chain rings and on that she's got the Vision metron carbon monocoque aero cranks at 165mm. On the end of those, she's got the Garmin vector three power metre pedals. She's got an 11 25 cassette and she also has Ceramicspeed bottom bracket bearings. \n\nOnto the wheels, and Michelle's using the Vision Metron 55 on the front and the Vision Metron 81 on the rear. And on those, she's using Vittoria Corsa clincher tyres. \n\nShe's got Vision carbon base bars and on top of that she's got a customised Vision component here which allows her to change the angle at which she has her poles. She's using the Carbon drag-to-zero arm cups and on the end of the poles and on her base bars she's got the sram red etap blips for changing gear. She's got the Vision brake levers which then goes down to the TRP cable disc breaks. Michelle is using the Fizik Mistica time trial saddle with its blunt nose and then she's using XLAB bottle cage including the gorilla cage on the back for extra grip, just to keep that bottle intact. Then on the downtube she's got the XLAB aero TT bottle and finally, she's using the XLAB stealth pocket for nutrition on her toptube. It weighs in at 9 kilos and now finally, let's hear the freehub sound. \n\nAnd now moving on to Michelle's race kit. And she's using TYR Yamamoto SCS swim skin and on under that she's going to be wearing the Sugoi Trisuit. She's also using a brand new customised Kask Kona aero Time trial helmet and it's got her own motto, 'keep smiling' and it even has little diamontes as dots on top the the i's, which is pretty cool. She's using the Fizik triathlon shoe and then finally, for the run, she'll be wearing the On Cloudflow Trainers.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3A\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/3B\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  What Is The Optimal Cadence To Run Off The Bike Fast? - http://gtn.io/OptimalCadence\nüìπ  Tom Bishop's Kuota Kougar Pro Bike - http://gtn.io/TBProBike\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nANDERS BOTHEN - BEATER HEAD 3\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
