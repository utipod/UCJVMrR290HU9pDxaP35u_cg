description = "Nerves before your triathlon are inevitable, but it's how you deal with these nerves that can make a big difference to your race performance. In this video, Heather  gives her top 10 hacks to calm your race day nerves.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/dY \n\nRace day nerves are thought of as negative but if the event means enough to you then they‚Äôre inevitable. We feel nervous when our mind senses that something significant is about to happen so it sends signals to the body that trigger the fight or flight response.\n\nThe response is part of the autonomic nervous system. It's the sympathetic branch and the adrenal-cortisol system that regulate the fight or flight reaction. This system was essential in primitive man, when they sensed danger the brain would send out signals for the body to be ready to fight or flee by sending blood and therefore oxygen to the muscles in preparation and taking it away from organs such as the stomach that don‚Äôt require it. Hence why you‚Äôd struggle to digest a big meal whilst nervous. \n\nAs a response to hormones being released, you‚Äôll notice certain symptoms such as increased perspiration, sweaty palms and an increased heart rate increase. Some people will feel nauseous and some will even be physically sick with nerves. Importantly though, you‚Äôll feel more alert which is a sign your body is ready to deal with what your brain is telling it is coming up. \n\nThese feelings might all have negative connotations but it is how we choose to label nerves and what we associate them with. For example, an increased heart rate is really helpful at the start of a race as you need the increased blood flow to get your muscles ready to work.\n\nIt‚Äôs also worth noting that we will all have different responses and feelings to nerves but it‚Äôs how we deal with those that will affect our actual performance. So, here are our 10 hacks to calm your race day nerves...\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/dX\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Bike To Run Triathlon Transition For Beginners | How To Do A T2 Transition - http://gtn.io/T2Transition\nüìπ Triathlon Race Psychology | Mental Preparation With Lionel Sanders & Lucy Charles - http://gtn.io/Psychology\n \nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nBlue Hills - Yellowbase\nInput - Brookii\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
