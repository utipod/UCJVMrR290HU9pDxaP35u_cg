title = "How To Run On The Road | Get The Most Out Of Running Training"
description = "I'm often surprised at how many people I see running purely indoors on the treadmills and hardly ever venturing outdoors onto the roads, and you might be thinking that road-running is purely for marathon runners or maybe people that race long-distance on the road, but actually, there are benefits that we could all have by just getting outside and giving it a go.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN \nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5e\n\nThanks to Club La Santa for the locations used in this shoot.\n\nNow, you're pretty much always gonna be sharing the road with other road users, so it's really important to make sure you're seen. Even in the daylight, try to wear something that's bright that just catches the eyes of the drivers and the other road users, and if you are running at night, it's probably a good idea to invest in a little head torch or maybe something that's got a flashing light behind you or on your arm.\n\nAnd that brings me on to the rules of the road. If you are somewhere where they drive on right, you probably want to run on the left-hand side and then if the worst comes to worst and you see a car coming towards you, you can just step off into the verge to move out of the way. \n\nIf you're a little bit worried about going outside on your own, then why don't you think about taking your phone with you as an emergency backup or if you don't want to carry that, just write an emergency number down and pop that in your pocket. \n\nIf one of the things that's putting you off going outside and leaving the comforts of the gym is not having loos nearby or maybe not having an energy bar in your bag, then just plan around that. If you plan a route that goes near your public bathrooms, that will solve that one, and maybe just put a bit of cash in your pocket and if you do suddenly get hungry or need a bit of sugar, run by your local convenience store. \n\nIf you are used to doing most of your running indoors on a treadmill, then the shoes you use for that will be absolutely fine for running on the road. You want something that's got a decent amount of cushioning because it is obviously hard.. \n\nOne of the advantages of running on the road are the routes are endless, and if you have a car, you can just jump in it and then pull out at a spot that takes your fancy. If you're worried about what to do with your keys, then why not just tie them onto your shoe or maybe just tuck them in your sports bra. \n\nIf you're a trail runner, you've maybe been getting a little bit bored of having poor conditions underfoot or the bad weather. Then why don't you try a little bit of road running? The roads will usually be cleared by most counsels, and if you're running between buildings or hedges, you'll have a bit of added shelter. You can jump in your car or hop on public transport and you'll soon be able to find some roads suitable for your training, and the best part is that it's free! \n\nWell, we would love to know what road running is like where you live or any tips you might have, so please let us know in the comment section below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/5f\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nHow to warm up for a run http://gtn.io/RunWarmUp4 üìπ \nTempo brick workout http://gtn.io/brickworkout üìπ \n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
