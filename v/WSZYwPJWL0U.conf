description = "What is the best bike for triathlon? Could your bike leg be faster in your next triathlon? GTN's ex-pro triathlete Mark Threlfall puts road bike vs TT bike to the test descending on hilly terrain.\n\nComment üëá with your predictions.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN shop: http://gtn.io/19\n\nFor flat triathlons, your choice of bike is probably clear. But, what about hillier events? Is there really an advantage to a super aero time trial bike or would you be better (given the choice) on a lightweight road bike?\n\nIn a previous video we have shown that the TT bike can match the road bike climbing, but what about descending?!\n\nThis is the ultimate test of TT setup vs road bike. If a TT bike can match a road bike on a descent as well as a climb, then we'd suggest that a TT bike is definitely the best bike for a hilly course. But, if a road bike is significantly faster, that makes things more complicated!\n\nTo put our theories to the test on this one, Mark rides his Cervelo S5 and then Cervelo P5X down San Salvador in Mallorca. \n\nWhat are your predictions for this one?
