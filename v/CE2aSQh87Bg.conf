description = "Carbon fibre aero wheels, they're an essential weapon for every triathlete. The ultimate finishing kit for triathlon and time trial bikes with deep aerodynamic rims adding speed, requiring less watts and looking super cool. Mark unboxes the latest aero wheels from Vision. \n\nIn association with Vision.\n\nEnter the promotion here: http://gtn.io/unboxvision\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/fJ\n\nVision's Metron 81 wheelset is the deepest aerodynamic wheel that they offer, perfect for triathlons and time trials, and have been updated for 2019. \nAvailable in clincher and tubular with disc brake options available, Vision have made sure they'll fit your bike. With all new hubs and rim designs the new Metron 81 model features laser cut brake tracks on the rim brake models. These promise increased stopping power in all weathers without compromising on weight. Vision have also updated the hub design to utilise angular contact bearings which not only last longer but also respond better to lateral pressure produced via pedalling. \nThe hubs are also compatible with both 10 and 11 speed Shimano and SRAM freehub designs, but have a new spoke lace design. A special 2:1 ratio on the rear wheel balances out the different tortional forces that a rear hub undergoes. With bladed spokes and external nipples the Vision Metron wheels are not only aero but also practical and easy to maintain. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/fI\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Michelle Vesterby's Pro Bike | http://gtn.io/MVSuperSlice\nüìπ Gear Ratios explained | http://gtn.io/GearRatio\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound:\nLucy's Game - Senchi\nConcrete Jungle 3 - Jan Chmelar\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
