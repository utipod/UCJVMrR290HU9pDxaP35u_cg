description = "The first part of GTN's 12 week triathlon training plan is here to help you train for your first event. Kickstart your training with these tips, sessions and advice on what you should do during your first two weeks of training.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/70\n\nSwimming - \nSwimming tends to be the discipline that is most daunting to people, especially so if it‚Äôs new to you. Swimming is largely about technique, which is quite hard to figure out on your own. Before you teach yourself any terrible habits, a good option would be to get someone to take a look at your swimming. That can simply be a training partner, a friend, or you could actually join a local swimming or triathlon club that might have a coach. \n\nSo, given the technical aspect of swimming, it is better to swim little but often to begin with. This will give you the best chance of learning any new skills. Providing you have the time to, a good starting point is to complete 2 swims per week, each of around 30-40 minutes.\n\nCycling - \nTo begin with, all your cycling training should be focussed on building fitness, and your confidence. Cycling is actually a very technical sport, more so than most people realise. So even if you have some cycling experience, it may well be worth spending a little time honing your skills first. Rather than heading out for rides at breakneck speeds, keep it to a conversational pace. This will allow you to build that base level of aerobic fitness and muscular strength, without overdoing it too soon. \n\nA good starting point could be two rides per week, at around 60 minutes for each. Now, it‚Äôs really important not to increase this too quickly. So we‚Äôre going to follow the 10% rule. Never go up in training distance or duration by more than 10% per week.\n\nRunning - \nIn a similar way to the cycling, all your running should just be at a steady and aerobic pace to begin with. It‚Äôs often the one that people get carried away with, and try to run too fast, too soon. And too fast, too often. If you are new to running, imply head out for a walk, and throw in the occasional 30 - 60sec easy run, and then build this up with time.\n\nDependent on your current level of fitness and running history, we would recommend starting out with no more than 30 minute runs. In fact, my personal experience is that the little but often trick also works wonders for running. If time allows, I would recommend doing 2 easy 20-30min runs in your first week, and in the second week just step this up slightly to 30-35mins. \n\nIf you found this video useful, don't forget to share it with someone who is also doing their first event!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/6-\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nHer Majesty 4 - Victor Olsson.wav\nMy Baby Knows (Instrumental Version) - Johan Gl√∂ssner\nSummer Vibe - Tomas Skyldeberg\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Choose Your First Triathlon - http://gtn.io/ChooseYourFirstTriathlon\nüìπ How To Train For Your First Triathlon | An Introduction To Triathlon Training - http://gtn.io/TrainForFirstTri\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
