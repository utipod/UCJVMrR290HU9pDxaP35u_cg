title = "Indoor vs Outdoor Running: What's The Best Way To Train For Triathletes?"
description = "Ex-pro triathlete Mark Threlfall explains the benefits of running on a treadmill compared to running outside. Both approaches have their benefits when preparing for a triathlon. However, which is the more powerful training tool? üèÉ\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/M\n\nRunning on the treadmill or running outdoors? They are very different but can both be valuable training tools if used correctly.\n\nIndoor Running - Treadmill\n- Nothing can stop you if you are running indoors, you protected from the elements and bad conditions and should therefore always be able to complete a session. \n- To make running on the treadmill more realistic, set the treadmill to a 1% gradient to account for the lack of wind resistance when running indoors.\n- The treadmill is a great tool for completing a specific session at a desired pace due to the consistent nature of the surface.\n- With regards to injury, treadmills are smooth and cushioned so reduce the impact of running but the repetitive movement can led to injury.\n\nOutdoor Running - Road, Track, Trails\n- It can be frustrating if you are not be able to do a proper run session if you the surface or weather conditions do not allow it.\n- One main difference with running outside is that you control the pace. On a treadmill you can't slow down, but outside you can drift off without noticing and therefore you need to keep on top of your effort level and pace.\n- Completing a target route and exploring can often be very motivating and seen as an achievent.\n- With regards to injury, the uneven surface can cause issues. Beware for dangerous areas, sprained ankles and stay aware on trails.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/N\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Run Like A Pro http://gtn.io/P\nüìπ  How To Run A Fast 5k http://gtn.io/O\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
