title = "Triathlon Bike Vs Road Bike - What’s The Difference?"
description = "For triathletes, there are two different bike options: a road bike with clip-on aero bars, or a dedicated triathlon bike, also known as a TT bike. Tri bikes are made to be fast & aerodynamic, but being heavier than road bikes, there is a penalty when riding uphill or on technical courses. Mark & James put the two bikes head-to-head in three different races to see which is best!\n\n0:00 Intro\n2:01 Hill climb\n4:35 Technical course\n7:09 Flat time trial\n8:50 Results\n\nUseful Links\nSubmit your Photo and Video to us 👉 https://gtn.io/UPLOAD\nCheck out the GTN Shop 👉 https://gtn.io/TeamKit\n\nWhich do you ride: a TT bike or a road bike?
