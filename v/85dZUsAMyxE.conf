description = "Cycling uphills in training is one thing, riding hills in a race is a whole different thing so here is GTN's advice on how to ride a hilly triathlon fast!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/9S\n\nThe Approach\nYou want to start thinking about the climb on your approach, not just as you hit it. It‚Äôs still race-day, so you can‚Äôt afford to fully back-off, but perhaps consider keeping a cap on it. For some, a slightly higher cadence also helps reduce the muscular fatigue leading into the climb. It‚Äôs also important to reduce any sudden surges or spikes in power before the hill - just try to maintain a constant effort level and settle into a nice rhythm. \n\nThe Entrance Of The Hill\nAs you hit the hill, you should start shifting down through the gears to easier gears. This will help reduce any spikes in power at the bottom of the climb, and that urge to maintain your cadence. Even if you don‚Äôt have a power meter this should be something you can feel through the pressure of your feet on the pedals - the aim being to maintain the pressure from the flat onto the climb.\n\nThe Body Of The Hill\nOnce you‚Äôre into the meat of the climb it‚Äôs important to try and find a groove and a nice rhythm again. If you‚Äôre riding to power, most athletes naturally find that they put out a little more power on the climbs, and struggle to hold back. However, I tend to advise capping your power at around 5-10% above your target race power. This still utilises this increase, but makes sure you‚Äôre not going into the red and causing any damage for later in the race.\n\nThe Crest Of The Hill\nIf you‚Äôve followed all these tips you should be ready to crest the top of the hill and settle straight back into to your target power, effort, or pace. As Matt Bottrill mentioned in one of our previous videos, this is the point that so many athletes lose considerable time. \n\nUltimately, you need to remind yourself of the run off the bike. Emptying the tank, or jumping into the red on the climbs will hamper that run - so aim for a nice evenly paced ride.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video and found it helpful, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/9R\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Cycle Faster For Free With Time Trial Specialist Matt Bottrill - http://gtn.io/CycleFasterForFree\nüìπ How To Climb On A Tri Bike Like A Pro - http://gtn.io/climbtribike\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
