title = "Should You Workout When You're Sick? | The Effects Of Training When You're Ill"
description = "Exercise is fantastic for us, but should you workout when you're sick? Mark explains whether you should exercise, how to recover, and when to return to training from sickness. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/fs \n\nExercise is fantasticfor us. It has a number of benefits, including improving the performance of our immune system. Moderate exercise is believed to stimulate the production of a type of white blood cell known as Th1 which the body uses to help kill off viruses and bacteria.\n\nHowever, as we begin to push our training harder and increase the amount of stress and fatigue upon our bodies we often see our immune system take a sharp turn in the opposite direction, and therefore putting ourselves at a higher risk of infection. Unfortunately, I have just been fighting an extremely tough bout of man flu, so it feels like a good time to discuss if you should be training when you’re ill!\n\nWhen most people get sick they grab some blankets, turn on the TV and curl up on the couch. But, triathletes aren’t like most people! Athletes are determined not to miss a single day of training, even if they have a cold or the flu. \n\nIs this a good idea? Or should you take it easy? \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. 👍\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/fr\n\nWatch more on GTN...\n📹 Top 5 Training Strategies When You Have No Time | Train Around Work Or Study - http://gtn.io/TrainWithNoTime\n📹 Using Heart Rate Variability To Maximise Recovery | Triathlon Training Explained - http://gtn.io/TTEHRV\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nBeats And RnB 5 - Merlean\nBeep Tone Readout 2 - SFX Producer\nDance And House Session 20 - Andreas Ericson\nEarthBound 3 - Joachim Nilsson (1)\nLounge Lizards 5 - Jack Elphick\nPool Chalk Cue 1 - SFX Producer\nPour Water 10 - SFX Producer\nPREL Special FX 302 - SFX Producer\nSci Fi Sonar Ping 3 - SFX Producer\nWonder - Cushy\n\nPhotos: © Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers – and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we’re here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube’s best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
