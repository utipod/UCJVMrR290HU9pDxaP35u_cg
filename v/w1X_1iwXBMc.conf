title = "Helle Frederiksen's Trek Speed Concept Pro Bike And Triathlon Kit"
description = "Check out the bike and kit of professional triathlete Helle Frederiksen. We're out in Lanzarote whilst Helle is in the middle of a rather intense training block so her Trek Speed concept is set up for training rather than racing.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/6x\n\nThe first thing we should chat about is this paint work. It's Trek's Project One custom paint work, which Helle has actually designed herself, with this rather striking blue for the main frame colour.\n\nStarting on the front end, she has a fully integrated Bontrager handlebar stem combo. In chatting to Helle, she loves just how adjustable this front end is. She's got an ever-so-slight tilt upwards of the aerobars and the rests, and that can be done really simply by tightening or loosening two bolts just to the centre. You can easily adjust the stack height underneath the rests, and also the width of the arm rests, as well, can be adjusted really easily. And then, a really cool feature is that you can put any poles in you like. And then, to finish it off, Bontrager have also got their own bottle cage, which should be neatly attached between the armrests. \n\nMoving on, the bike is fully kitted out with Shimano Dura Ace Di2 9150, which we can see on the end of the poles here their shifters work the rear mech. And then, we also have shifters here, on the base bar, which work the rear mech and the front mech. \n\nAnd whilst we're here, we may as well talk about the brakes. So let's start with the front brake, which is well-hidden. It's hitting the front fork, that's for aerodynamic reasons. And rather than being a right fast to try to make any adjustments, Trek was good about that. So there's a couple of little openings on either side so you can make those fine adjustments, and then, the rear brake is hidden under the bottom bracket, with its own aeroshell, very neat. \n\nAnd moving back through the bike, and as we said earlier, she's a fully kitted out Shimano Dura Ace, so we have Dura Ace crankset here in a 53/39 race shift. I should say, actually, for a lot of the races this year, she will be switching to a 54 big ring. She's currently got a 167.5 crank lengths, and on the end of those, she's riding a Look KEO blade pedals.\n\nAnd let's move on to the wheels. And given that Helle has only just signed to Trek and Bontrager, she doesn't currently have her Bontrager training wheels here. But she has told us that for race day, she'll probably be opting for the Bontrager Aeolus 5s or 7s. And while she is here at training, she has got Continental Grand Prix 4000 tyres in a 23 mm width. So whilst she's out here training, she's wanting to ride to power. So she's actually got a power tap hub on her training wheels, but when she comes back from Lanzarote, another thing that she'll be having added to this bike is an SRM PowerMeter. Now for the saddle, and this is the Bontrager Hilo triathlon-specific saddle.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/6y\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Kim Morrison's Giant Trinity Pro Bike - http://gtn.io/KMProBike\nüìπ  How To Do An FTP Test? - http://gtn.io/FTP\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
