description = "Here's the Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL6 of Great Britain's Sophie Coldwell. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7R\n\nSophie took bronze last year at the Under 23 World Championships and off the back of that she has qualified for her first Commonwealth Games later this year. For 2018, she will be riding the S-Works Tarmac SL6 in a 52 centimetre frame.\n\nSpecialized say they've shed almost 200g off the weight of the new Tarmac. They have dropped the seat-stays for aerodynamics and included a more aerodynamic seat tube. They've allowed a clearance for up to 30mm tyres and the fork comes in different sizes for the different frame sizes, also for aerodynamics. The end result, they claim, is that the bike saves almost 45 seconds over 40 kilometres compared to another lightweight bike in the same category.\n\nSophie's Tarmac has primarily Specialized componentry from the wheels to saddle and is kitted out with Shimano Dura-Ace 9100. She has finished her bike off with the Vision Mini-TT clip on bars and an InfoCrank Classic power meter. \n\nAre you a fan of this simple, but smart bike of British athlete Sophie Coldwell?
