title = "How To Do A Flying Mount | Can Heather Learn From A Pro Triathlete?"
description = "Whether you are racing an Ironman or a Super Sprint triathlon, the flying mount is a skill that can save you valuable seconds in every race! Pro triathlete Mark Buckingham teaches our very own Heather Fell this \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/4T\n\nThanks to Club La Santa for the locations used in this shoot.\n\nWell as you probably know I've done a few Ironmen already but I've never actually done anything shorter or faster so I've never had the pressure of having to do a flying mount, but I feel it might be time that I've got to give it a go. Bucko for his sins has very kindly offered to try and teach me. I think me might have his work cut out. That's my teacher.\n\nTo be honest, I've never been particularly good at mounting, even as a kid. So I was brought up riding ponies and horses and my parents spent years trying to teach me how to mount and I was told I looked like a sack of potatoes. So I'm not really holding out for jumping on a bike. It is slightly smaller than a horse, I guess. Maybe a smaller saddle if that's a good thing. Might be uncomfortable if I miss it though. Yeah it looks so easy when he does it. He can do it slow or fast. It's just like hopping on. How can that be hard? Now obviously you're an ITU athlete, and you're used to, you have to get on fast, but for me does it really make any difference, 'cause I'm confident, I'm safe just getting on my bike.\n\nSo as you get your bike from the racking and you come into the mount line, the fundamental difference between stopping and getting on your bike and doing the flying mount is basically, how Heather showed, she came to the line and actually decelerated and stopped to get on the bike before pedalling away. Whereas with the flying mount you're accelerating all the way, over the line and then onto your bike.\n\nShe's doing really good. It's confidence it is with a lot of these things. She was worried about just putting all the weight on one pedal to begin with but she's got the knack of that now. She's just flying through it. She was really hesitant at even giving it a go to begin with and now you at her, she just can't stop herself. And that's what you wanna do, once you've got over that first scary part, just putting your weight on one pedal then you can just do it time and time again then. \n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/4U\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nWho It Was - Bonkers Beat Club\nTurn The Page (Elphick Remix) - Matt Sierra\nThe Long Walk Home 2 - Magnus Ringblom\nSun Melt Waves - Gavin Luke\nRevolt - Henrik Olsson\nOnce Upon A Time In Detroit 2 - Axel Ljung\nLinen - Frook\nFrom The Underground (Instrumental Version) - Sebastian Forslund\nEveryone Knows - Daniel Gunnarsson\nClimbing Through Air 3 - Tomas Skyldeberg\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  GTN's Ultimate Brick Workout, Mark Vs Mark - http://gtn.io/brickworkout\nüìπ  5 T1 Transition Tips - http://gtn.io/T1Tips\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
