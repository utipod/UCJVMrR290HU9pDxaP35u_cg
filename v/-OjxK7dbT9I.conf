description = "Do you wish you had an aerodynamic triathlon bike to have alongside your regular road bike? In this video, Heather delves into the aerodynamic adaptions that you can easily make to your road bike to turn it into a triathlon bike and help you go faster in your next event. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/84\n\nIn association with Profile Design.\n\nHaving both a triathlon bike alongside a regular road bike, is a luxury that many of us can‚Äôt afford. However, there is so much you can do to your road bike to get similar benefits you‚Äôd experience with a triathlon specific bike. Thanks to our partners at Profile Design, we‚Äôre going to be delving into those aerodynamic alterations that you can easily make to your road bike to help you go faster in your next triathlon. \n\nThe adaptions that you can make to your road bike include:\n- Adding clip on aerobars\n- Adjusting you handlebar height\n- Adjusting your saddle position\n- Adding a front hydration\n- Adding a top tube bag\n- Thinking about where you have your bottle cages\n\nThese are a few simple changes, all of which add up and together can end up making a significant difference to your aerodynamics on race day! Play around with the set up until you find what works for you. And don‚Äôt forget, there‚Äôs no point in being aero if you can only hold that position for a few minutes so make sure you are still comfortable.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your triathlon friends üëç \n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/83\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Clip On Aero Bars Vs Drops - http://gtn.io/AeroBarsVsDrops\nüìπ Time Trial Bike Vs Road Bike: What's The Best Triathlon Bike For Descending? - http://gtn.io/TTvsRdDescending\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nDollar Needles - Splasher!\nMade By Man 2 - Anders BotheÃÅn\nRue Saint-Antoine - Tomas Skyldeberg\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
