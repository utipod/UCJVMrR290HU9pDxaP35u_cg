title = "Why Do Triathletes Need To Run Fast? | Speed Training Session For Endurance Runners"
description = "Speed isn't something many triathletes train often. In fact, many endurance athletes don't feel the need for speed in their training at all! If we neglect speed training, however, we miss out on a whole load of performance benefits. In this video, Heather explains why you need to run fast, and takes us through a great session for improving our speed!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/xU\n\nSpeed intervals can seem daunting, but they needn't be excessively challenging to start off with. This session comprises of five 800 meter efforts at 5km race pace, with 2 minutes recovery in between each effort. If you feel that's too much you can always reduce the number of efforts, similarly, if it's too easy you can increase the intensity of your efforts or the number of repetitions. You can also adapt this session if you haven't got a track by running 3-minute intervals at 5k race pace effort with 2 minutes rest in between each interval!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/xT\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ https://gtn.io/PerfectTechnique\nüìπ https://gtn.io/3RunWorkouts\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nES_Alright Come On (Instrumental Version) - Sebastian Forslund.mp3\nES_ASR10 - Pro Reese.mp3\nES_Calling Me - Ooyy.mp3ES_Can I (Instrumental Version) - Katnip.mp3\nES_Keep on Walkin' - Rockin' For Decades.mp3\nES_Maybe Not - Dylan Sitts.mp3ES_Paradigm - Raccy.mp3\nES_What a Wave - _91nova.mp3\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal-winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nFelt bicycles: https://gtn.io/Felt\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
