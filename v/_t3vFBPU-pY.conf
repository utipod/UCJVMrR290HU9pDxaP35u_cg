description = "Walking in a race can sometimes help you clock a faster overall run time. This might sound crazy, but ultra-endurance runner Holly Rush explains more!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/f5\n\nIn association with TrainingPeaks - http://gtn.io/TrainingPeaks \n\nAid stations:\n\nRegardless of the race distance, be it your local club sprint event or an international Ironman, there will be an aid station of some sort out on course. Local club races and the like might simply have some cups of water and a box of gummy sweets, but the more sizable the event and the longer the race, the more involved your aid station is likely to be - providing all manner of drinks, gels, bars and savoury snacks. \n\nIt is these points on the run that you can target as a predetermined walking segment to both ensure you take on the available nutrition effectively (not spilling it all over yourself whilst trying to both jog and drink - trust me, it‚Äôs harder than it appears!) and also lower your heart rate and perceived exertion levels too.\n\nHills:\n\nDepending on your chosen or upcoming event, the terrain can clearly vary - from entirely flat through to extremely hilly. However, even if for example, your race is largely flat, there could still be short snappy hills on the course and this is where research and planning are key for your event. In these situations, you might be better to take it easy up the hills so you don't burn too many matches for later in the race.\n\nHave you ever walked through an aid station or up a hill?
