title = "The Best Triathlon Pro Bikes Of 2017"
description = "Since launching GTN in the summer, we've been fortunate to take a closer look at some impressive pro bikes. And it's been a tough challenge, but we've picked some of our favourite pro bikes. So here they are. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5y\n\nOur very first pro bike and not a bad place to start, with a double-Olympic champion, Alistair Brownlee. Now Alistair stepped up the distance and to a non-drafting format, so it's quite interesting to see his setup on his Scott Plasma TT, having spent so many years on a road bike. \n\nAnd on his Scott Plasma he had Zipp 808 wheels with SRAM Red eTap and the Scott Plasma integrated storage. Now, we can't see how different Alistair is here due to injury, but hopefully, we'll see him back even stronger in 2018. \n\nNow this one was just head at the Iron Man 70.3 World's. And, actually, after the race, we discovered that Tim Reed wasn't actually in the best shape, having suffered from illness in the lead up to the race, so we were extremely grateful for his time pre race. \n\nNow, Tim mentions that a lot of the adaptations are for psychological gains as much as aerodynamics, and we see that with his carbon plate over his crank set for aerodynamics, where he's riding a 162.5 mil crank length, which is pretty short. He also mentions how adjustable the bike is. So he's gone for a slightly more upright and more comfortable position with his bars. And you notice that it's got rather striking paintwork, which is available to the pros and we actually saw on Ben Kanute's road bike, his Trek Madone, at the ITU Grand Final in Rotterdam. \n\nOf course, we have to include The P5X, the bike that really does turn heads. And it is still the leader of the superbikes. And as you've probably noticed, Heather and myself have had the pleasure of riding one, and as you can see, I've got mine right here. And I can tell you it really is fast. Now, Suzie first got hands on the P5X when it launched at Kona last year in 2016. Now, this year, she rode it to a 6th place finish overall. \n\nAnd on that bike, she was riding with a HED Jet 6 on the front and HED Jet 9 on the rear, with customised decals on the wheels. She also had it fully kitted out with CeramicSpeed bearings and the CeramicSpeed OSPW Jockey Wheels. She also had the rotor to empower parameter with the rotor Q-Rings. \n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/5z\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nDM_013_003_Hide And Seek_Israel Medina\nBeat Them Up 3 - Jan Chmelar\nDivergent - Ooyy\nQuiet Contemplation 18 - Christian Andersen\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Tyler Butterfield's C√©rvelo P5 Pro Bike - http://gtn.io/TButterfieldP5\nüìπ Alistair Brownlee's Scott Plasma - http://gtn.io/BrownleeProBike\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
