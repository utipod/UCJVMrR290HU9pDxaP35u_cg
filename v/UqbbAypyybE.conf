In this video, Heather explains when to replace your much loved running shoes and why it's so important!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7V\n\nHave you found the perfect running shoes you never want to part with? Are you guilty of wearing your trainers until they‚Äôre literally falling off your feet? If so, you‚Äôre actually increasing your risk of injury.\n\nTriathletes and runners wear trainers to protect our feet from the surfaces we run on as well as to keep our muscles and joints functioning optimally. As shoes wear, their support, form and grip will all diminish at different rates. With wear, your running shoes will become thinner and the midsole layer of cushioning will also decrease. Our bodies are used to adapting to different surfaces so your hips, knees and feet will compensate for this but these changes will eventually lead to injury, the key is changing them before you get to this stage.\n\nA general rule for replacing shoes is somewhere between 300-500 miles or 450 - 600km. Time wise, it‚Äôs even more vague but a guide of 12-18 months is often used. The mileage guide is very rough as things like your weight, running style, type of running and running surface can all affect the wear. \n\nWhether your shoes have air, gel or springs makes little difference as it‚Äôs actually the foam midsole made of ethyl vinyl acetate EVA which wears at the same rate. This means that there‚Äôs no significant difference between most brands. Try out Heather's tests to see how worn your running shoes are!\n\nIf you found this video useful, don't forget to give it a thumbs up and share with your running friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link -http://gtn.io/7U\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Repair A Wetsuit - http://gtn.io/WetsuitRepair\nüìπ How To Run A Fast Half Marathon With GCN's Dan Lloyd - http://gtn.io/FastHalfMarathon\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nDrip Drop Plop - SFX Producer\nKnockout 1 - Da Tooby\nReminisce 3 - Da Tooby\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
