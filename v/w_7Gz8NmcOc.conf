title = "Is This The Future Of Running Shoes? | The Christmas GTN Show Ep. 19"
description = "It's the GTN Christmas Show! Merry Christmas from the GTN team. In this weeks show we discuss the announcement of some new events for 2018, Winter Triathlon races, and the exciting move to include Graphene in running shoes!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5I\n\nAs always, a huge thanks for all your comments, likes, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nIn last weeks show we discussed swim cancellations, and asked you what you would like to replace the swim with. The top vote was running, however, rowing received a surprising number of votes too. This week we want to find out how many of our viewers will be exercising on Christmas Day. \n\nWith many of us heading into the Winter, we also discuss Winter Triathlon events, and the benefit of Cross-Country Skiing for our Triathlon fitness. A number of Pro Triathletes use it for just that, but how many of our viewers have tried Cross-Country Skiing for their off-season training?\n\nThe 'super-material', Graphene, was announced back in 2004 and has since been used in cycling and some other products. We are now going to be seeing it in running shoes, thanks to the running brand Inov-8. It's flexible, strong, conductive, biodegradeable and light. What can't this material do?!\n\nThe #GTNTribe map is growing! We're loving the submissions and hearing about everyone's clubs, please keep sending them in. \n\nAs well as the latest in all things triathlon, we have our usual segments such as #GTNPainCave and our CAPtion competition. \n\nWe hope you enjoy episode 19 of the GTN Show, let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/5J\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  GTN's Guide To The Long Run - http://gtn.io/LongRun\nüìπ  The Best Custom Kit Of 2017 - http://gtn.io/customkit2017\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
