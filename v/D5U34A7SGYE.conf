title = "How To Choose An Indoor Trainer | Which Wahoo Trainer Is Right For You?"
description = "Indoor trainers are a really efficient use of time and great for getting quality bike sessions in. But with so many on the market these days, finding the right one for you can be a bit of a minefield. So I'm going to help you to choose an indoor trainer.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/6B\n\nIn association with Wahoo.\n\nMagnetic, direct-drive, fluid, air, smart trainers; where on earth do you start? Well there are so many more options available for indoor trainers compared to when I first started cycling, and to demonstrate this Wahoo have kindly stepped in. They've loaned us a few of their products that we can run through in the same range that is used by Ironman world champion and Olympic Games gold medalist Jan Frodeno, and even Team SKY. \n\nThis is the KICKR SNAP from Wahoo. It's Wahoo's more affordable trainer; it's another wheel-on design, meaning it's fixed and mounted in the same way as the previous trainers, but this is a smart trainer. This means that you can connect the trainer to your bike computer, your smartphone, your tablet, or even your computer via Bluetooth Smart or ANT+, so you can monitor your training as you go, and actually in some cases you can increase the intensity on these as well. \n\nI'm currently using the Wahoo ELEMNT BOLT bike computer but you can use other bike computers, and if you don't have a bike computer you can actually use the Wahoo Fitness app to capture the data. But the beauty of the smart trainer, and actually a really popular option, is to connect it to something like Zwift or Trainer Road to give you that kind of outdoor, real feel.\n\nThe Wahoo KICKR: we're taking it up a level here now; this is Wahoo's ultimate indoor smart trainer. This is in fact a direct-drive trainer, and that means that we have to remove the rear wheel, and then we place the dropouts of the bike onto the axle of the trainer, which also has a pre-mounted cassette. Now that just saves us all that effort of having to use a turbo tyre, or even having to switch a wheel out with a turbo tyre on. It is a relatively heavy device: it comes in at around 21kgs. As with all smart trainers really, a really cool setting with this smart trainer is the ERG mode. So say you want to sit at a set power or you're trying to follow an intervals session, then you can just do that: set it, the turbo does the rest for you regardless of the terrain or your cadence. \n\nSomething even cooler - the Wahoo KICKR CLIMB. Now we've been talking about indoor riding feeling realistic, but how about your bike actually moving with the simulated terrain? The forks lock into the KICKR CLIMB, so the bike will literally tilt upwards or downwards with ascents or descents. In fact, you can range from ascents of 20% all the way back down to descents of 10%. \n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/6C\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nBronx Back In 95 2 - Jan Chmelar\nKnockout 3 - Da Tooby\nLast Chance Man - MaÃäns Billner\nUrban Poetry 2 - Jan Chmelar\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Increase Your Power On The Bike - http://gtn.io/increasepower\nüìπ  Indoor Cycling Interval Workout On The Ironman World Championships Course - http://gtn.io/IndoorIntervalWorkout\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
