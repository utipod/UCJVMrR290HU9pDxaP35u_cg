title = "Top 6 Swim Cap Hacks | Wear Your Swim Cap Like A Pro"
description = "It might sound obvious but you'll be surprised at the method some people use to try and put on a swimming hat. Now, I've still got childhood memories of my mother trying to scrape my hair into a latex hat and it usually ended in tears and that was until I learned how to do it myself. \n\nNew Swim Cap?\nIf you've bought a brand new swimming cap, you'll find that it sticks to itself, your head and your hair. Now, the best way to avoid this is add a little talcum powder on the inside and the out. Give it a rub and then it'll be nice and comfortable and ready to wear. \n\nTip For Long Hair\nIt's down to personal preference but I like to just tie my hair in a bun at the back of my head and then I put my hat on from the back to the front. Now, you can try going from the front to the back but you're usually left with bits sticking out the bottom. \n\nRace Day Cap\nThe race organisers will usually provide hats that must be worn throughout the race, so don't go swapping it before your event as a colour will have been assigned specifically to your swim wave and don't panic if your race hat splits or gets a hole as the organisers will usually have spares. \n\nWear Your Cap Correctly\nYou'd be surprised that the variation in position of caps on some swimmers heads. Now, most hats have a line running down the centre and the idea is you want that going from the front to the back of your head, not across because let's face it, we don't really want to add any extra drag. Now, another thing to bear in mind is making sure your hat's far enough down over your forehead because there's nothing worse than it gradually creeping up and taking your googles off with it when it falls off in a race. \n\nColour Choice\nWhen buying a new hat, consider choosing a bright colour for open-water swimming, so you can be seen easily if you're training alone and it's important to be clearly visible to boats using the same water and in the worst case scenario if you do get into trouble, you'll be found more easily. \n\nDouble Up\nNow, another little extra tip if you're heading to your first race and you want to look like you know what you're doing, put your usual hat on first and your goggles just as you would do normally and then put the race cap over the top. This protects your goggles and stops them getting knocked off by other swimmers in a mass start. \n\nIf you've enjoyed this video, give it the thumbs up like and subscribe to GTN by just clicking on the globe!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3l\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/3m\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nHyperactive 2 - Anders BotheÃÅn\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Complete A Swim Recce Like A Pro - http://gtn.io/SwimRecce\nüìπ  How To Look After Your Wetsuit Correctly -\n http://gtn.io/WetsuitCare\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
