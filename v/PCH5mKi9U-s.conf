description = "You‚Äôre a couple of weeks into training for your first triathlon and you‚Äôre over one of the toughest hurdles; starting. Now it‚Äôs time to increase the training volume, learn how to fuel on the bike and progress into weeks 3 and 4.  Here is part two of our ‚ÄòHow To Train For Your First Triathlon‚Äô series.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7u\n\nSwimming - \nNow that you‚Äôve been in the pool a few times over the past couple of weeks, you‚Äôll have hopefully started to find your feel for the water, and started getting the hang of your technique. But, don‚Äôt worry if you haven‚Äôt, swimming is a very technical sport, so don‚Äôt panic if you‚Äôre not progressing as quickly as you are with the other disciplines.\n\nProviding you‚Äôre ready to, you can start increasing the distances of our swimming. This doesn‚Äôt have to be the overall distance, but more the length of reps within the session. The idea is that you get you to a point of comfortably covering the triathlon swim distance, all in one go. You should still aim to complete 2 swims per week, but now over a duration of 40-45 minutes.\n\nCycling - \nWith 2 weeks of cycling under your belt, you should be ready to start increasing the duration of your rides. Try to maintain 2 rides per week, progressing them to around 75 minutes in the 3rd week, and up to 80 minutes in your 4th week.\n\nIf you will struggle to fit 2 rides in then an indoor trainer can be really useful. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to have a turbo trainer at home, you can fit bike sessions in before or after work when there may be less light on the roads. Or, you could of course use a static bike at your local gym, or join a spin class for some motivation!\n\nRunning - \nYou want to progress the running in a similar way. If you‚Äôre starting out with short runs within a walk, then you can begin increasing the length of those runs ever so slightly. But if you‚Äôre already doing sustained runs, then you can push them up to around 38-40 minutes in your 3rd week, and around 40-45 minutes in your 4th week.\n\nRemember to keep them all easy and aerobic for now. Continue aiming to run twice per week. If you‚Äôre not comfortable with covering this kind of distance or duration just yet, stick with the current duration and keep the training consistent.\n\nWith this increased training volume, you‚Äôll likely be feeling quite tired and, that‚Äôs normal. Make sure that you don‚Äôt underestimate the training and how tired it can make you. It‚Äôs really important to recover well and absorb the training that you‚Äôve done. This means fuelling well, getting enough sleep, stretching, and taking recovery days!\n\nAnd finally, don‚Äôt forget to enjoy yourself üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/7t\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Train For Your First Triathlon | An Introduction To Triathlon Training - http://gtn.io/TrainForFirstTri\nüìπ Triathlon Training Plan | Kickstart Your Triathlon Training | Week 1-2 - http://gtn.io/FirstTriWeek1-2\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
