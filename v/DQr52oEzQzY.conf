description = "Your wetsuit is likely to be your most expensive piece of triathlon kit after your bike, but do you know how to care for it properly? Heather explains how to wash, dry and store your wetsuit to prolong its life!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/2V\n\nYour wetsuit is an expensive piece of kit so you want to make it last as long as possible. There are several things you can do to prolong the life of your neoprene suit:\n\nWash your wetsuit - rinse with lukewarm water and remove any dirt when the wetsuit is still wet (this makes it much easier). You should also rinse your wetsuit after swimming in a pool as chlorine isn't good for your suit. After this let your wetsuit dry naturally out of sunlight and away from too much heat such as a radiator.\n\nStore your wetsuit - store your wetsuit in a dry place. Either hang your wetsuit over a hanger with a straight bar or fold it as shown by Heather and this will prevent too many creases forming and will ensure your wetsuit is in good condition when you go it it next summer!\n\nIf you have any tips for looking after a wetsuit then add them in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/2W\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nJungle Blue - Daniel Gunnarsson\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  4 Essential Swim Workouts - http://gtn.io/SwimWorkouts\nüìπ  9 Open Water Swimming Tips - http://gtn.io/OpenWater\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
