description = "This GTN unboxing is a little gadget that could answer your slow puncture worries and also help improve your riding performance. It‚Äôs the Quarq Tyrewiz, a real-time pressure sensor for your tyres. And we have three to giveaway!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/bp\n\nIn association with Quarq.\n\nEnter here: http://gtn.io/WinTyreWiz\n\nThese little devices from Quarq are the first of their kind. It‚Äôs a really exciting idea and they will read the pressure of your tyres in real-time. \nThis means you will immediately see the pressure values as you‚Äôre pumping them, as you‚Äôre riding them and even as you‚Äôre getting a puncture. And that is really just scratching the surface of what they can offer us as cyclists and triathletes.\n\nThere is an app that works with the sensors and it‚Äôs a really straight-forward pairing with the tyre pressure is showing to a +/- 2% accuracy. The app can also provide personalised tyre pressure recommendations based on your weight, bike weight, tyre width and wheel size and then alert you if your pressure is outside of it‚Äôs recommended range. \n\nWhat do you think the biggest benefit of these gadgets are?
