description = "Struggling to get to the gym at the moment, we‚Äôre here to help! Heather has got 20 minutes' worth of strength and conditioning exercises that require no specialist equipment - you just need to be ready to work hard! Full work out below üëá\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/IN\n\nThe workout!\n\n3 Minute Warm-Up:\nBegin by jogging on the spot, we want to warm the whole body up so add in the arms with forward punches, then out to the side and finally up above, repeat this pattern for a whole minute trying to speed up the feet and the arms.\n\n30‚Äù of bodyweight squats, trying to keep these at a good pace and dropping as low as you can comfortably manage at this moment. Remember a nice open chest and flat back throughout. \n30‚Äù of skipping on the spot with a knee drive and arm drive\n30‚Äù of forward lunges w R leg from 12 o‚Äôclock, to 1,2, all the around to 6 o‚Äôclock\n30‚Äù on the other leg\n\n15 Minute Main Set: We‚Äôve got a nice mix of 6 exercises to get through here. We‚Äôre going to work for 30‚Äù on then 15‚Äù off right through. Once you‚Äôve completed all 6 we want you to take an extra 30‚Äù then repeat the full set twice more.\n\n- Skaters\n- Press Ups\n- Glute Bridge\n- Single-Leg Squats\n- Tricep Dips\n- Lunge Jumps\n\n2 Minute Cool Down:\n\n- Pick up walking on the spot and reach both arms overhead. Grab hold of one of your wrists and pull it up and across your body, this should bring on a nice side stretch, keep gently walking then swap over and do the other side. \n\n- Time to move focus to the triceps, take one arm across your body and pull it gently with the other arm, repeat on the other side. \n\n- Take a nice wide stance with both feet facing forwards, drop down to one side feeling a gentle stretch on the inner thigh, keep it dynamic and swap between sides for a few reps. You can then swivel to a forwards backward lunge and stretch out your hip flexors. From here move up and back to feel a stretch in the opposite hamstring. Swap legs and repeat on the other side.\n\nPlease do continue with some of your own stretches beyond this.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  15 Minute HIIT Workout üëâ  https://gtn.io/HIITWorkout\nüìπ  Fat Burning Interval Session üëâ  https://gtn.io/BikeIntervalWorkout\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nES_Under the Weather - Damma Beatz\nES_Golden Crates - Dusty Decks\nES_Spinning the Wheels - Dusty Decks\nES_Stone Cookies - Dusty Decks\nES_The Red Light Special - Matt Large\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
