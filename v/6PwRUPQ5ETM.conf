description = "If you're watching this, it's likely that you're interested in triathlon... but are you addicted?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/du\n\nIn a study by Dr. Josephine Perry, she recruited 255 amateur endurance athletes from the age of 19 to 41. The study found that ultra-endurance athletes are at risk of becoming addicted to exercise, especially triathlon. In triathlon, it has been found the longer the race distance, the higher rates of addiction. To prepare for such a long race, the number of training hours needs to increase. As the amount of time training increases, the triathlete‚Äôs risk of addiction also increases. So the question is, are you addicted?\n\nAs well as this, we discuss:\n- The Ironman 70.3 World championships\n- The √ñtill√∂ SwimRun World Championships\n- The Alcatraz Triathlon\n- British Triathlon recruiting guides for Tokyo 2020\n- Your awesome GTN fan content\n- And much much more!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/dt\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ 5 Exercises For Tight Shoulders | Shoulder Mobility & Activation - http://gtn.io/TightShoulders\nüìπ Top 5 Essential Run Skills To Master | Running Tips For Triathletes - http://gtn.io/5RunSkills\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nBroke No More - Seamus McNamara\nClown Business 2 - Josef Habib\nMy Time - Jan Chmela\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
