description = "Heather was at Challenge Family's The Championship triathlon and caught up with Ellie Salthouse about her race bike setup and triathlon kit. Here we have her Trek Speed Concept tri bike, tri suit, race shoes and aero helmet.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/aQ\n\nSalthouse is riding a custom painted Trek Speed Concept fitted with full Dura Ace Di2 using the Synchro Shift. She runs 167.5mm cranks which you don't see very often! The chainrings are 53/39 and Salthouse has an 11/25 cassette. The bike comprises Bontrager components and is rolling on HED wheels with Vittoria Corsa tyres. Salthouse even gets given the option of three tri suits for each event.
