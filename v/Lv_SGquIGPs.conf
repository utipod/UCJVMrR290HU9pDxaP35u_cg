It is a fast transition between the lengths that helps keep the momentum and speed up during training and can save valuable seconds in the swim section of a triathlon.\n\nTop tips\n- Build confidence. Get used to rotating in the water. To start the flip movement, draw your chin and knees into your chest. Your head will direct your body to begin rotating. To stop water going up your nose, trickle air out as you turn. Progress by turning close the wall to increase your spacial awareness.\n- Approach. The T on the bottom of the pool is a useful tool as you approach the wall. You have 1 or 2 strokes as your head passes over the T.\n- The turn. Finish your final stroke and leave you hand by your side. Initiate the turn and remain compact until your feet meet the wall. Plant your feet side by side against in a squat position. Bring your hands together to allow you to push off in a streamline position.\n- Exit. Push off whilst rotating so that you are facing the bottom of the pool. Make sure you hold a tight and streamline position whilst breaking into a butterfly kick. Take your first stroke or two and then only then take your first breath.\n\nThis is not an easy skill to master so practise, practise, practise.\n\nGood luck!
