So much so that this puts a lot of people off swimming altogether. \n\nHaving a swimming hat line, red rings around your eyes and wearing a distinct Eau de chlorine scent is bad enough but heading from the pool with wet bedraggled hair isn‚Äôt a great look. We know a lot of friends who even time their swims around hair washing days but this does limit you somewhat.\n\nWe do start with a disclaimer, as we begin making this video, we genuinely don‚Äôt know how to keep our hair dry whilst swimming but by the end of this we are determined to find a solution so get ready to have a few giggles but ultimately hopefully we‚Äôll all learn how you can enjoy your next swim whenever you like without the worry of factoring in hair drying time. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/zn\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Top 9 Pool Swimming Hacks | Swim Training Tips üëâ https://gtn.io/SwimHacks\nüìπ How To...
