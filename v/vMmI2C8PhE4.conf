description = "The dolphin dive is a great way to get an advantage on your competitors during your next triathlon. In a race with an open water swim entry and exit, a good dolphin dive can save you valuable seconds!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/aP\n\nIf you‚Äôre doing a triathlon with a sea swim, then dolphin diving on entry and exit could give you a real edge on your competition. It might look a little bizarre, but it won‚Äôt look so silly when you leave everyone behind at the start. \n\nThe dolphin dive is for that depth of water that‚Äôs too deep to run, but also too shallow to swim. You won‚Äôt want to repeat it too many times - it‚Äôs pretty tiring. But, a few dives in a row will certainly give you an edge over those trying to wade out, or those that have started swimming too early. As soon as you feel like you can start swimming comfortably, just break into a full stroke. \n\nDo you usually do a dolphin dive during a triathlon beach entry and exit?
