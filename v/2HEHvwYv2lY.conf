description = "This is the GTN Show, welcome. Last week, we saw another world championship's event. It was the XTERRA over in Maui, so we'll be looking at the results from that. As well as bring you race results from other events around the world.\n\nOn top of that, we have some world records with a difference. Drug testing and age group races, as well as some news that could put a stop to triathlon in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\nLast week, we wanted to find out what you thought was the most important title in triathlon. And, admittedly, there are quite a few to choose from, so we gave you the poll with those five options.\n\n[Mark] Well, in fifth place, it was the ITU Long Distance triathlon world title. Then in fourth, it was the XTERRA world title. In third, it was the 70.3 world title. And in second, it went to the ITU Short Distance. And then in first place, with a whole of 64%, it was the IRONMAN world title.\n\n[Heather] It looks like long distance wins over the shorter but more intense ITU; and, therefore, I think I got a little victory.\n\nI think you beat me out with that, yeah.\n\nWell, moving on, this week it's coming into off season, or it might already be off season for you, and we want to know what you're doing with it and how long you take off, if you take off any time at all?\n\nYeah, so those options are: none, one to two weeks, two to four weeks, or four weeks and more.\n\nI'm definitely in the four weeks or more.\n\nMine's been certainly a prolonged off season, right?\n\nWell, we'd love to know what you do with that break as well, so do make sure you leave your comments in the section below. And if you want to vote on the poll just click on the link above my head. Now recently there have been a couple of impressive, yet slightly different, world records that have been broken. Both of which I can't even imagine completing, let alone being competitive at.\n\nWell, speak for yourself, Heather. I think this one might suit me - The Beer Mile. And you start it by downing a pint of beer, and then completing four and a bit laps of an athletics track, downing a pint every lap. So you may wonder if this requires any athletic prowess, but Corey Bellemore proved it does. He did it in an astonishing time of four minutes and 33 seconds to set a new world record.\n\nThat's impressive.\n\nWell, there is another record that is very impressive and different, but I'm not sure I could compete in this one.\n\nNo, I'm not sure you could, Mark. Jessica Bruce ran a three hour, 22 marathon six months after giving birth. But if that's not impressive enough, she did it whilst pushing a double buggy with her six month old and her two year old son in the buggy. And that was weighing about 30 kilos. She's added this record to her previous record of the single buggy marathon time as well.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3w\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/3x\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  8 Tips To Get You Through Winter - http://gtn.io/Wintertips\nüìπ  What do the pros eat for breakfast pre-race? - http://gtn.io/Preracebreakfast\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
