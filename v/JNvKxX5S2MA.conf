title = "What Is The Best Age For Triathlon? | The GTN Show Ep. 37"
description = "On this week's GTN Show, we chat Mark turning 30!!! This sparked the discussion about the best age to do triathlon, and at what age your performance will drop. We also have lots of race results and triathlon news this week, including the announcement of the new Zwift Triathlon Team!\n\nThe GTN Show is for every triathlete, swimmer, cyclist and runner!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/9f\n\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nMark was put in the 30-34 category at XTERRA Malta the other week. It was a bit of a shock but got us thinking about the age of athletes in triathlon. We've often heard 30 regarded as the prime age for triathletes, but there have been some incredible professional athletes racing into their 40's such as Tim Don and Craig Alexander. So what is the optimum age to compete in triathlon? \n\nIn episode 37 of the GTN Show we also discuss:\n- The Zwift Triathlon Academy\n- The water quality for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics\n- Challenge Tri Slam\n- Super League Triathlon Announcements\n- XTERRA, Challenge and Ironman race news\n- Hydrations sensors, Quarq tyre pressure reader and the Aeropod on Kickstarter\n\nAs well as the latest in all things triathlon, we have our usual segments such as the #GTNPainCave, #GTNTRIBE and CAPtion competition.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/9e\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Triathlon Training Explained | Swim Drafting Position - Hips Vs.
