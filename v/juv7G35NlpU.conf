title = "Aero Vs. Non Aero | What Is The Fastest Position For Running Off The Bike?"
description = "We've looked at the difference between an aero and comfortable position on the bike and how it affects our riding. But, how about taking this a step further, and seeing how they affect our run off the bike?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/8i\n\nGTN's comfort versus aero investigation found the relaxed and comfortable position to be the slowest and then the slammed and aggressive position to be the quickest. Following on from this, we want to see how these different positions affect your run off the bike.\n\nTo do this, Heather completed 3 tests in different aero positions. Each test included:\n- 10 minutes at 180 Watts\n- 5 minutes running off the bike at a 1% incline and 14kph\n- 30 minutes break\n- Measuring heart rate, PE and O2 consumed throughout.\n\nLeave your predictions for this experiment in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you liked this video, don't forget to share it with your triathlon and cycling friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/8h\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Comfort Vs.
