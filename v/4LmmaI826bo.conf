Once you can run 5km continuously, you have really just opened the doors to so much more. You are someone that can sustain running continuously for a good period of time. And running that extra 5km isn‚Äôt so big a deal.\n\nThe 10km distance is a milestone for most runners and one of the most commonly targeted times for the 10km is to do it in less than an hour!
