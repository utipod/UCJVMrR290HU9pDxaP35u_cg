description = "Last year we did a Triathlon on a budget, and we did the whole thing for a little over Â£300, but was that actually the cheapest tri possible? Probably not. So this year, we upped the ante, and lowered the budget, for GTNâ€™s cheapest triathlon attempt no.2... eBay + Â£100? Could we do it?\n\nUseful Links\nSubmit your Photo and Video to us ðŸ‘‰ https://gtn.io/UPLOAD\nCheck out the GTN Shop ðŸ‘‰ https://gtn.io/TeamKit\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nðŸ“¹  Triathlon on a budget ðŸ‘‰ https://gtn.io/BudgetTri \nðŸ“¹  Watch our Editorâ€™s Choice Playlist ðŸ‘‰  https://gtn.io/editorschoice \nðŸ“¹  Watch our weekly show, The GTN Show ðŸ‘‰  https://gtn.io/GTNshowPlaylist \n\nPhotos: Â© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nðŸŽµ Music - licensed by Epidemic Sound / Artlist ðŸŽµ \nA Mental Breakdown (Instrumental Version) - Sven Karlsson\nFeed My Ego (Instrumental Version) - Sven Karlsson\nFlightmode - Chris Shards\nHad to Move On - Peter Crosby\nIt Was Never Enough - Sunbreak\nJailhouse Blues - Peter Crosby\nKnowledge Is Power - Matt Large\nLet It Out (Instrumental Version) - Sebastian Forslund\nOh La La - TAGE\nPrinters Alley - Roots and Recognition\nRadio Static - SFX Producer\nRun the Race (Instrumental Version) - Martin Hall\nRust on the Tracks - Peter Crosby\nSay You Will (Instrumental Version) - Wellmess\nStanding on Your Own (Instrumental Version) - Paper Twins\n\n#gtn #triathlon #swimbikerun #swim #bike #run #budget \n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
