description = "Hello! My name is Fraser Cartmell, and I'm the new member of the team at the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/gT\n\nThank you to Dream Team TV for the race footage of Fraser.\n\nI raced ITU, draft legal triathlon throughout my university years and although I competed at the likes of European and World Championships at Junior and U23 (and racing at some World Cups for GBR), I was never going to be truly competitive and I was fully aware of that... but I didn't want to stop racing.\n\nAnd luckily, that's where long course racing was able to fill the void. I began middle, or half distance racing in 2007, and was delighted to manage a win at my very first Ironman 70.3 which wasn‚Äôt a bad way to get going!  \n\nIn all honesty, if you'd told me a decade ago that I'd come away from the sport having won an Ironman title, multiple Ironman 70.3s, top ten at World 70.3 Championships and competing at the Ironman World Championships as a pro more than once, I probably wouldn't have believed you.\n\nThat being said, would I have liked to win more, be more competitive over the years? For sure! But nonetheless, I'm content with what I've achieved in the sport. \n\nIf you have any questions for Fraser, make sure to leave them in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/gS\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Run A Sub 40 Minute 10km Race! | Running Training & Tips - https://gtn.io/10kmSub40\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCamera Clicks - SFX Producer\nCamera Shutter 6 - SFX Producer\nGood Time - Snake City\nHorror Textures 6 - Rannar Sillard\nHurricane Season - Sarah, the Illstrumentalist\nLet Go - Sebastian Forslund\nMedieval Myths 13 - Andreas Ericson (1)\nMedieval Myths 13 - Andreas Ericson\nMore Sweep - Johan Hynynen\nPut It Down - Da Tooby\nScottish Highlands 9 - Magnus Ringblom\nSex Drugs And Dr Martens 2 - Sven Karlsson\nWind Storm Constant 1 - SFX Producer\nWives Club 4 - Gunnar JohnseÃÅn\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
