description = "We're back with newly turned pro triathlete Sam Pictor to discuss all things Triathlon including a hot topic - is 1X the future?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/av\n\nRight, so let’s chat a little about The Championship race this weekend. Heather is going to be bringing us the results later on...but the bit I’m interesting in, is some of the equipment choices by athletes.\n\nNow, it’s a super flat and fast course. Aerodynamics are key, but I noticed a few athletes taking it a step further with this 1x setup. \nThis is anything new, time trial riders have been doing it for years, and I’ve seen the odd triathlete doing it from time-to-time...but there does seem to be an increase as of late. \n\nAt The Championship I spotted it on Andi Drietz bike, Anthony Costes and Kimberley Morrison’s. The idea being that there is no need for the small ring on a pancake flat course - so why not remove it. As Matt Bottrill explained in a recent video with him, it can save somewhere in the region of 2-3W. \n\nYour reducing friction through the front mech, you can have the chain the perfect length for the single ring...and by increasing the size of the chainring you can improve the chainline efficiency.\n\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link 👍 http://gtn.io/aw\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nEssential Swim Tips 📹 http://gtn.io/6swimmingtips\nTrisuit VS Wetsuit 📹 http://gtn.io/wetsuittrisuit\n\nPhotos: © Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nMusic: Cambodia Rain - SINY\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers – and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we’re here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube’s best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
