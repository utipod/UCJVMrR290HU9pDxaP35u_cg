description = "What is the best bike for triathlon? Could your bike leg be faster in your next triathlon? GTN's ex-pro triathlete Mark Threlfall puts road bike vs TT bike to the test on hilly terrain.\n\nComment üëá with your predictions.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN shop: http://gtn.io/n\n\nFor flat triathlons, your choice of bike is probably clear. But, what about hillier tris? Is there really an advantage to a super aero time trial bike or would you be better (given the choice) on a lightweight road bike?\n\nThis is the ultimate test of TT setup vs road bike. If a TT bike can match a road bike on a climb, we'd suggest that a TT bike is the bike for a hilly course. But, if a road bike is significantly faster, that makes things more complicated as it's a fair assumption that the road bike won't be faster on the hilly sections of your bike leg.\n\nTo put our theories to the test on this one, Mark chose to ride his Cervelo P5X first on the climb on San Salvador in Mallorca. After a coffee and a rest, he then attacked the climb on his Cervelo S5. What are your predictions for this one?
