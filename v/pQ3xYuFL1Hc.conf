description = "This week we bring you The GTN Show from the Ironman Triathlon World Championships in Kona. The men's course record was broken this year, but will anyone ever go under 8 hours?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/30\n\nThanks for all the likes, shares and subscribes so far!\n\nThis week we bring you a full summary of both the men's and women's races in Kona with Daniela Ryf taking her 3rd consecutive Ironman World Championship and Partick Lange taking his 1st victory in the men's race. Mark and Heather are lucky enough to be joined by James Cunnama and he gives his thoughts on how the race panned out.\n\nWe didn't give you much chance to guess correctly in last weeks poll. The majority of you, 73%, thought that Jan Frodeno would win the men's race in Kona however the eventual winner was Patrick Lange. The German broke the run course record last year and this year he smashed the overall course record with a time of 8:01:40. This week we ask if 8 hours will ever be broken?\n\nAs well as our coverage from the race we bring you our usual segments including CAPtion competition and #TRIDIY. This week we are lucky enough to have Tyler Butterfield (the king of custom) check out your triathlon hacks and bodges.\n\nWe hope you enjoy episode 10 of the GTN Show!
