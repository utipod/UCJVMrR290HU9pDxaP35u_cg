description = "You may have used sweet spot workouts in your training before, but do you know what it‚Äôs doing? Or, how to use it to it‚Äôs best advantage? Mark answers these questions and gives you 3 sweet spot workouts to try!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/dg\n\nIn association with Training Peaks - http://gtn.io/TrainingPeaks\n\nSweet Spot - as the name suggests, this refers to a specific training intensity that aims to deliver the ultimate ‚Äòbang for your buck‚Äô, where the training effort and volume are ideally structured for maximum physiological gains. This makes the idea of sweet spot training particularly appealing to triathletes with limited time for training.\n\nBut to work out this sweet spot intensity we need to know our Functional Threshold Power, or FTP for short. This is our best sustained effort for 60 minutes, essentially our Lactate Threshold, the point at which lactate begins to accumulate in the blood faster than it can be flushed out. \n\nSo, knowing our FTP, we can work out our training zones. Our sweet spot is the area just above tempo and just below threshold. It kind of crosses into the upper Z3 and lower end of Z4, when using the Dr Andy Coggan 7 Zone system. It‚Äôs defined as  being between 84% to 94% of our FTP or 75% to 85% of our maximum heart rate. \n\nIf you‚Äôre riding by feel, your sweet spot is  ‚Äòmoderately hard‚Äô - it‚Äôs a tough but sustainable tempo just short of your upper threshold. \nYou might be able to hold a short conversation with your riding mates, but to be honest, you‚Äôll probably want to save your breath for the effort. \n\nThe beauty of sweet spot training is that it has the same physiologically benefits and promotes the same adaptations as doing threshold, but it‚Äôs far less taxing on the body you can do more of it and recovery quicker from it. \n\nHave a go at the workouts in this video and let us know how your get on in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/df\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Improve Your Triathlon Training | What Is FTP? - http://gtn.io/FTP\nüìπ How To Train With Power | GTN's Guide To Your Training Zones - http://gtn.io/trainwithpower\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nAngel Dust - AGST\nMother (Instrumental Version) - Staffan CarleÃÅn\nOrdinary Days (Instrumental Version) - Johan Svensson\nSatellite - Onda Norte\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
