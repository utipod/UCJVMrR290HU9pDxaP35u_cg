description = "The triathlon mixed team relay is a new addition to top level triathlon racing and the World Championships are taking place at WTS Hamburg this weekend! Heather explains everything you need to know about the event and looks forward to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/bS\n\nThe mixed relay was first introduced at the World Championships back in 2009 in Iowa, USA. It was Switzerland who won this first title. \nFrom 2013 the World Championships have been held in Hamburg, Germany and 2018 will be the sixth year in a row for the host city. \n\nWe have seen the mixed relay included in the last two Commonwealth games and the YOG‚Äôs and now it is set to make its debut on the largest stage of all, the Olympic Games. The IOC announced the inclusion of the triathlon team mixed relay in June 2017, it was added along with some other individual sports such as fencing, athletics and swimming who had also been piloting mixed gender team events. \n\nMarisol Casado, President of ITU and IOC Member obviously welcomed this news and emphasised that it‚Äôs an event that demonstrates women and men can compete together but both are equally important to the success of the team.\n\nRelays are nothing new to triathlon. The team mixed relay however is significantly different. There must be two men and two women, all four must do all three sports in the typical triathlon order of swim bike run. The women always go first and and third, the men second and fourth.\n\nTo keep the excitement in this new format of racing the distances have been kept to a 300m swim, 7k bike and a 1500m run. These distances can vary slightly from course to course when you add in the transitions and relay handovers but the athletes are usually racing for somewhere around 20 minutes each and the total race is over in less than 90. It is fast and furious and expect the lead to change numerous times throughout. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/bR\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Triathlon Race Psychology | Mental Preparation With Lionel Sanders & Lucy Charles - http://gtn.io/Psychology\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCause I Am Coming Home (SLCT Remix) (Instrumental Version) - Johan Gl√∂ssner\nHigh Energy Teens 8 (Sting Version) - Victor Olsson\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
