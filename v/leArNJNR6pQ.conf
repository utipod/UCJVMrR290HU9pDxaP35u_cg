description = "This week we‚Äôre looking at Heart Rate Variability, we‚Äôll be explaining what it is, how to use it and how it relates to recovery. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/cF\n\nAs athletes our main aim is to get stronger and faster. We do that with a combination of stressing the body through training then allowing it to rebuild and get stronger through recovery. \n\nBut, knowing if you‚Äôve adequately recovered from your previous training is not always so easy. You can use things like Training Peaks training stress score, resting HR, subjective scores on how your feeling and measure your sleep to guide you and your coach as to how your body is coping with the training and general stress. \n\nThey are all useful tools but Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can give you a more accurate measurement as to the overall stress your body and mind are dealing with each day. And, most importantly give a clear indication as to whether you‚Äôre ready for the next hard session. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nFor more information on this topic, check out the following links from training peaks:\n- Using Heart Rate Variability to Schedule the Intensity of Your Training - http://gtn.io/TPHRVIntensity\n- 9 Common Misconceptions About Measuring Heart Rate Variability - \nhttp://gtn.io/TPHRVMisconceptions\n- How to use HRV Training to Identify Weaknesses - http://gtn.io/TPHRVWeakness\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/cG\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Triathlon Training Explained | Overtraining And Recovery - http://gtn.io/TTEOvertraining\nüìπ Pool Swim Stroke Vs Open Water Triathlon Stroke | How Do They Differ? - http://gtn.io/PoolVOpenWater\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCastle To Ruin STEMS DRUMS - Martin Hall\nChoir Ambience - Rannar Sillard\nHeart Goes Numb STEMS DRUMS - Johan Svensson\nLove For The Ocean (Tigerblood Jewel Remix) (Instrumental Version) - Martin Hall\nWe Were Always STEMS DRUMS - Martin Hall\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
