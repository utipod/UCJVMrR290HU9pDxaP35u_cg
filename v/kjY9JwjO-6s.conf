description = "In the triathlon world this week, weâ€™re talking unique training venues, the growth of our sport and the passing of Sir Roger Bannister. We also discuss the first triathlon on the WTS circuit this year and think about why triathletes crash so much!\n\nDon't forget the GTN Show is for every triathlete, swimmer, cyclist and runner!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7L\n\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nOur main discussion this week is why triathletes crash so much! As triathletes, we tend to be at the end of a lot of abuse from our cycling friends over the amount that triathletes crash... but is that really the case? After the WTS race in Abu Dhabi this weekend it would appear so with many pro athletes going down on s slippery F1 track. Let us know your thoughts on the topic in the comments below!\n\nAlso on the show this week, we discuss:\n- The passing of Sir Roger Bannister, the first person to break the 4 minute mile.\n- A smartphone from Land Rover, one for the adventurers.\n- Asics agree a deal with the ITU.\n- Bath Half Marathon cancellation.\n- New members in the Women for Tri initiative.\n- Racing news from WTS Abu Dhabi, Ironman New Zealand and Durban Ultra.\n\nAs well as the latest in all things triathlon, we have our usual segments such as the #GTNPainCave, #GTNTRIBE and CAPtion competition.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/7K\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nðŸ“¹ How To Run Off The Bike - http://gtn.io/RunOffBike\nðŸ“¹ Cycle Faster For Free With Time Trial Specialist Matt Bottrill - http://gtn.io/CycleFasterForFree\n\nPhotos: Â© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers â€“ and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, weâ€™re here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTubeâ€™s best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
