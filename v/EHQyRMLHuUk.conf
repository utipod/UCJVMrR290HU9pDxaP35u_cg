Heather is here to explain why speed work is so important for swimming and how to incorporate it into your training!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/yi\n\nWho doesn‚Äôt want to swim faster or a personal best in their next event? If you‚Äôre a triathlete watching this you might be wondering why you need speed work when your race distance is only ever as short as 400m and could even be as long as 3800m. We mean you don‚Äôt see sprinters swimming a 400m right? \n\nCorrect triathlon race pace isn‚Äôt flat out from the gun and in a race, you need to be able to run to your bike but that doesn‚Äôt mean speed work should be avoided.\n\nTraining faster will help you to develop your aerobic engine and spikes of really fast work will touch on your anaerobic system, whilst getting you used to that uncomfortable zone. Heather is here to explain why speed work is so important for swimming and how to incorporate it into your training!\n\nWhat is Critical Swim Speed- https://youtu.be/wooLaOhLg6U\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/yh\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Improve Your Swimming Power üëâ https://gtn.io/swimmingpower\nüìπ Why Do Triathletes Need To Run Fast? üëâ https://gtn.io/RunFast\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nTiny Room Bop - [ocean jams]\nCarpet - Dylan Sitts\nHot Water - Dylan Sitts\nLast September - Dylan Sitts\nNo Clue - Dylan Sitts\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal-winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nFelt bicycles: https://gtn.io/Felt\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
