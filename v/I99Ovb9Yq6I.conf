title = "Triathlon Training Plan | Taper And Race Preparation | Weeks 11-12"
description = "It is the final couple of weeks before the big day - your first triathlon. All the hard work has been done and it‚Äôs time to put those finishing touches to your training. Weeks 11-12 are about tapering and recovering so that you‚Äôre ready for the event.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/8M\n\nThis is Part 5 of our ‚ÄòHow To Train For Your First Triathlon‚Äô series.\n\nWith it being just 1 or 2 weeks before the race, there‚Äôs no need to continue cranking your training up. In fact, it‚Äôs time to start considering your taper and preparing yourself for race day. Hopefully by now, you will have covered the race distance continuously during your training, giving you extra confidence for the event. But if you haven‚Äôt already then don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs amazing what you can do on the day with some adrenaline.\n\nIn terms of tapering, this essentially allows your body to absorb all the hard training you‚Äôve been doing, and prime you for race day. This doesn‚Äôt mean kicking back and relaxing; you want to keep some intensity there to remind your body what it‚Äôs supposed to be doing, but you should drop the training volume a little whilst maintaining the number of sessions per week. This does however mean slightly shorter sessions and reducing the distance. You can break these sessions into smaller chunks, and focus a little more on the quality. \n\nThis is the fun bit now, so enjoy it. \n\nIf you liked this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/8L\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Your First Triathlon - GTN's Ultimate Guide - http://gtn.io/FirstTriathlonSeries\nüìπ How To Fix A Bike Puncture On Race Day - http://gtn.io/PunctureRepair\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nGet Back In The Game - Forslund Svensson\nUplifter (Instrumental Version) - Sebastian Forslund\nWasted (Instrumental Version) - Ramin\nDinner Party 03 - Anders BotheÃÅn\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
