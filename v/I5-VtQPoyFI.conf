description = "The Canyon Speedmax is a record breaking bike. Jan Frodeno and Patrick Lange have ridden this bike to the last 3 Ironman World Championship titles along with the Iron distance record. And now... Mark is getting his hands on one!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/e2 \n\nIn association with Canyon.\n\n"For today‚Äôs video, I have flown out to Germany to meet our new partners of the channel, Canyon! Yep, that is the Canyon Factory behind me... it‚Äôs an exciting day!\n\nNow, I think it‚Äôs fair to say that Canyon have made a huge mark in the cycling and triathlon world over the last decade. In triathlon alone they have helped produce 3 Ironman World Championship titles and an Iron distance record, all using the Canyon Speedmax triathlon bike... and guess what... I am picking my very own one up today!\n\nInterestingly, anyone can actually buy a bike from Canyon and come and collect it as I am today. But, the bit you don‚Äôt normally get to see, is through these doors. So, before I collect my bike, let‚Äôs take a look around the factory, and see what goes into the making of the Speedmax!"\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/e3\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Cycle Like A Pro | Cycling Tips For Triathletes - http://gtn.io/BikePro\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCabinet Door Open 5 - SFX Producer\nChill RnB Soul 2 - Merlean\nCrescendo Chopper - SFX Producer\nDoor Electrical 1 - SFX Producer\nFrostbite - Yellowbase\nHot Rod Rebels 1 - Victor Olsson\nHot Rod Rebels 1 STEMS DRUMS - Victor Olsson\nIn Your Arms - Henyao\nJail Security Door 6 - SFX Producer\nPortal - Henyao\nPREL SSFX Glitch 13 - SFX Producer\nRestless Minds - Yomoti\nRiser To LFE 1 - SFX Producer (1)\nSafe Door Open 4 - SFX Producer\nShine On You (Instrumental Version) - Gloria Tells\nSunday Brunch - Dylan Sitts\nTime Keeps Moving On - Henyao\n\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
