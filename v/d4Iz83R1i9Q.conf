title = "How To Improve Your Triathlon Training | What Is FTP?"
description = "Thanks to Quarq for the products used in this video. All opinions expressed are the presenter's own.\n\nIf you've spent a little time doing triathlon or cycling, you'll probably have heard the term "FTP." But what on earth is it? Well, in cycling terms, these three letter stand for "functional threshold power." And knowing your own FTP is a pretty powerful tool for determining your training zones, measuring your improvement, and setting your rate intensities. \n\nSimply put, your FTP is the highest average power you can sustain for an hour. But you will be pleased to hear you don't have to do a 60-minute time trial to get your FTP; there is a shorter test, the 20-minute FTP test. And the nice thing about this test, and probably the only nice thing, is that anyone can do this, more or less anywhere. There's no need to go into a special laboratory to be tested; you can easily do this yourself in your own time, meaning you can retest regularly from time to time. \n\nAll you need for the test is a bike and a means of measuring the power, and that can be a power metre on your bike, a smart trainer or a static gym bike with integrated power. And from my experience, having a power metre on your bike is perhaps the ideal, because it not only allows you to do the test anywhere, it also allows you to utilise your power metre and your new FTP data on every ride. \n\nBefore anything, we need to make sure we do a good warmup with a couple of hard efforts to really prepare the legs. And this isn't the sort of thing we can warm up for in five minutes, either. You should allow yourself a good 15 minutes or so to really make sure you're ready to nail the test. The test itself requires you to ride as hard as is sustainable for 20 minutes. Now, there are a few different FTP test variations, but the 20-minute test is a proven test used by many of the pros, and relates well to the style of riding we do in triathlon. \n\nOnce you've completed your 20-minute effort, the number you want to be looking at is your average power. Now currently, that is only for 20 minutes, so we want to translate that to your 60-minute FTP. And to do that you want to take 95% of that average power and you can do that by multiplying it by 0.95, or you can input it into a number of online calculators. And once you have your new FTP, you can then calculate your training zones. And again, you can do this with a number of online calculators, or even some training software will do this for you.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3C\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/3D\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCHRISTIAN NANZELL - YHELLO\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  What Is The Optimum Bike Cadence To Run Fast Off The Bike? - http://gtn.io/OptimalCadence\nüìπ  5 Essential Bike Skills To Master - http://gtn.io/5BikeSkills\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
