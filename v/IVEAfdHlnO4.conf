title = "How To Ride On Aerobars | GTN's Step By Step Guide"
description = "Aerobars are designed to make you more aerodynamic and therefore faster. If however you are not confident on them or in the wrong position the benefits become questionable. Getting started on aerobars can be difficult, so here is a step by step guide on how to use them. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/6p\n\nHow To Start\nStart out on the turbo. This is a safe environment where balance is not a problem. Get a friend or coach to look at your position here as it‚Äôs easy to make any adjustments before you head out on the road. \n\nPosition\nStart off by making your position comfortable. There will be plenty of time to get more aero and aggressive with your set up. Raising the stem is one way to make it less of a challenging position and tilting the bars upwards can help too. \n\nGradual Progression\nChanging any position whether that is in swimming, cycling or running takes time for your body to adjust before it feels ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Make sure you have plenty of time to adapt to the bars before you intend to race on them. \n\nStep by Step\nStart by practising taking one hand off the handlebars. Getting confident indicating and drinking whilst cycling along will set you up nicely. Next just practise placing one hand at a time onto the bars keeping your other firmly over the hood. Hold it for longer each time and make sure to alternate on both sides. Once this feels easy it‚Äôs time for both. Start with your preferred side, get comfortable then bring the other hand across. \n\nBuild It Up\nKeep the time on the bars fairly short to start with. Practising moving into and out of the position as you need to be confident in reaching back to your brakes efficiently and safely. When you‚Äôre happy in your new aero position increase your pace and spend more time in it.   \n\nHow To Fuel/Drink\nDrinking and eating in the aero position is a more advanced skill. Obviously if you‚Äôve got an aero water bottle between your bars you should just have to locate the straw with your mouth whilst keeping both hands on the bars in front of you. If however you've attached a normal drinks bottle between the bars or your using one behind the saddle or on the down tube then it might be necessary to quickly get out of the aero position to take a drink. \n\nStretching\nBeing on the aero bars puts more strain on your lower back and hamstrings and can tighten up your hip flexors a little more. Therefore make sure you keep on top of a regular stretching and conditioning routine to enable you to find that efficient position. \n\nIf you liked this video, give it a thumbs up and make sure to share it with someone who would find it helpful üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/6q\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \nDon't Stress - Andreas Jamsheree\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Speak Like A Triathlete | Triathlon Jargon Buster - http://gtn.io/TriJargon\nüìπ  How To Train For Your First Triathlon - http://gtn.io/TrainForFirstTri\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
