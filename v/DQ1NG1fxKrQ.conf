title = "GTN Unboxing: ROKA CP-1X and GP-1X Sunglasses"
description = "We‚Äôre taking a look at some new goodies from ROKA. Instead of the usual ROKA wetsuits and trisuits you usually see on GTN, it's the GP-1X and CP-1X sunglasses.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/cW\n\nIn association with ROKA.\n\nENETER HERE üëâ http://gtn.io/WinUnboxingRoka\n\nWhilst we all want a good looking pair of sunglasses, that‚Äôs not all the CP1-X and GP-1X offer. They're designed for performance, and for being functional. \n\nThey both have titanium wires running through the core of their frames, so you customise the fit of the sunglasses. Those are then wrapped with an ear sock in Roka‚Äôs patented GEKO elastomer material. That all adds to the fit and grip, so that there is no risk of the sunglasses moving or slipping during use. That same GEKO material is used on the nose piece. And to further improve the fit, those are available in 3 different sizes.\n\nUltimately, a pair of sunglasses should do their job without you really noticing, Mark thinks that's the sign of a good product. And you‚Äôre not going to notice these - the CP-1X weigh just 29g, and the GP-1X weigh just 26g. Just to put that in context, that‚Äôs almost 10g lighter than most sunglasses on the market!\n\nFor such a small product they pack quite a punch! The lenses contain a series of coatings that has anti-scratch, anti-fog and anti-reflective properties. And, because we all hate fingerprints and marks on our lenses, they have a hydrophobic coating to stop moisture from settling. This prevents fingerprints better, and helps to make cleaning more easy. \n\nGet your hands on some by entering at the link above!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/cX\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How Fast Can You Make Amateur Triathletes? | The Specialized Zwift Academy Triathlon Team - http://gtn.io/ZwiftAcademy\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nBright Oceans - Smartface\nWillow Trees - Guustavv\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
