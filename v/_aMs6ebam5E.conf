description = "In triathlon training and racing, you‚Äôll almost certainly be faced with an incline or decline at some point on the run. Running downhill at speed is a skill and if you can carry confidence into your racing, it‚Äôs a great way to make up some time or even put in an attack on your competitors. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/92\n\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nIncluding hill reps into your running programme is common. The focus is usually on the uphill efforts, but it‚Äôs also worth spending a bit of time concentrating on improving your downhill running. Be mindful of this skill, and practise running at different speeds on different descents within a variety of sessions to master it.\n\nThe key things to think about, and then practise, when running downhill include:\n- Your posture\n- Your foot placement\n- Your cadence and contact time with the ground\n- Using your arms for balance\n- Where to look ahead\n\nWhen developing your skills running downhill, it is important to start slowly and build up as you become more confident in your ability.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/91\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Run Uphill - http://gtn.io/RunUphill\nüìπ Run Workout: What Is "Kenyan Hills" Training? - http://gtn.io/4y\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nEmotions - AGST\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
