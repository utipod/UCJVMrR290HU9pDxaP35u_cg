title = "How To Get Aero | Find The Ultimate Aerodynamic Position With Bart Aernouts"
description = "Mark is joined by uber biker, and Challenge Roth winner, Bart Aernouts to discuss finding the ultimate aerodynamic position for your next triathlon or time trial.  \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/74\n\nAs much as 80% of the total drag while cycling comes from your body rather than the bike. It's impossible to eliminate this drag however, there are steps you can take to make yourself more aerodynamic and in turn, faster!\n\nBefore getting into a fully aerodynamic position, it's important to think about the length of the race you are doing so that you can balance comfort and aerodynamics. An aggressive position is unlikely to be sustainable for longer races such as Ironman events and therefore finding a middle ground between the two is often the best solution.\n\nA great place to start is getting a bike fit. This will ensure that you purchase a bike that fits correctly and allows you to get into the correct ultimate aero position without having to 'bodge' it.\n\nWhen it comes to the position, Bart's tips include lowering your head, \nhaving the correct arm width and finding the ideal saddle position. Check out the video for all the details! \n\nIf you like this video, don't forget to give it a thumbs up and share with your triathlon and cycling friends!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/75\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nDivergent - Ooyy\nTroubling - Daniel Gunnarsson\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ 8 Best Value Triathlon Upgrades - http://gtn.io/TriUpgrade\nüìπ How To Improve Your Triathlon Training | What Is FTP? - http://gtn.io/FTP\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
