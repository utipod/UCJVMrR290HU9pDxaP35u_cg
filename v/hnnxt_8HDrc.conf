title = "What's Your Pre-Race Breakfast? | GTN Ask The Pros"
description = "Nutrition is obviously a key part of racing. So we've had the opportunity to go around the pros and find out what they have for breakfast on the morning of a race. \n\nWhat do you have on the morning of a race for breakfast?\n\n- Ah, good question. It's normally pretty simple. Just a bowl of porridge, so nothing too exciting, but it works for me.\n\n- Ah, I just have eggs and cheese, that's it.\n\n- Ah, rice.\n\n- Normally in long distance stuff, you've got eat pretty close to the start, so simple stuff. A bit of cereal, a bit of toast, a banana, something like that.\n\n- Ah, porridge, maybe two slices of toast and a bit of coffee just to get the ol' system working.\n\n- Oh, that's pretty interesting. I have some beetroot juice and then I have a porridge enriched with some rice and oats and blueberry jam, and some nonfat plain yoghourt and some coconut oil. So it's an interesting twist, but I like it.\n\n- So I used to have porridge and eggs and now I go for jam and toast.\n\n- Muffins. Muffins are just this, just a bomb of calories. Not necessarily the best calories, but they transport well, and you can stick 'em in bags and stuff and who cares if they get squished because they just turn into this goo-ball and they taste good and plus, I like chocolate so I give myself a little treat before the day begins. Yeah, I'm a muffin man, for sure.\n\n- Some cereal and toast and jam.\n\n- Always oatmeal and that's every single day, not just race day. Always oatmeal, yoghourt, blueberries, maple syrup.\n\n- I like to have scrambled eggs and toast. I try and eat as much as I can, but I tend to feel a bit nervous before a race so I can't get that much in, but if I'm not too nervous, it goes down quite well.\n\n- Of course, I'm German, so I have bread with banana and peanut butter on it.\n\n- Usually I like to have like a chocolate muffin or something. You wake up and it's a 4:00 a.m. or whatever it is, you're not that excited to eat, but you're never not excited to eat a chocolate muffin. It's a good way to get some calories and yeah, some energy. I've tried eating eggs or something, but it doesn't really sit well sometimes at 4:00 a.m. so a chocolate muffin is always pretty good.\n\n- I have rice bread, like four slices, with some jam and an energy bar and a double espresso.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3n\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/3o\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Q & A With Alistair Brownlee - http://gtn.io/BrownleeQA\nüìπ  Emma Pallant's Pro Bike - http://gtn.io/BMCTm\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
