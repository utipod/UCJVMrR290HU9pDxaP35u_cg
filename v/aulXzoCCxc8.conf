title = "8 Running Drills You Should Do | Run Faster In Your Next Race"
description = "In my humble opinion, running drills should be part of every triathlete's programme. They're not only gonna make you faster and stronger, but they're also gonna help with injury prevention. So these are what I call the fantastic four. So we're gonna go through four running drills, four hurdle drills, and then four strides. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5j\n\nThanks to Club La Santa for the locations used in this shoot.\n\nLet's get into it. So for each one of these drills, we're gonna go from the yellow line to the cone, so about 20 or 30 metres of track, and then do a walk back recovery to keep it nice and active. And we're gonna go through each drill twice. \n\nSo the first drill we got is high knees. This is an old-school favourite. We've all done it at some point. So with high knees, the focus is on driving that knee up, keeping the toe up, and the leg at 90 degrees, and a nice, fast cadence. So after you've done one, you can do a walk or jog back recovery, and then repeat again. And maybe for the last two, you can get halfway, and really pick it up and really open the thrall. \n\nSo after you've done those twice through, you can go on to the next drill, heel flicks, or butt kicks to our American viewers. For this one, you need to flick your heel to your backside and keeping a nice, shallow knee. So keeping the knee down, and driving that leg up towards your bum. And you also wanna be driving your arms, and keeping your head looking forward. \n\nSo the next drill is high skips, and with high skips, it's a very plyometric-oriented drill, meaning there's quite a lot of strength involved. And this is really good to translate over to the bike, 'cause it's really focusing in on that leg strength. On this drill, you need to focus on all those key elements again, so the posture, and you're really gonna be driving up through that stationary leg. But then on the landing, you want a nice, soft landing that's quite reactive as well, which is then gonna propel you into your next skip. And remember, it's opposite arm, opposite leg. \n\nSo the final drill is a variation on a side skip, and this takes a little bit more coordination, so don't worry if you don't get it first time. So to walk you through it, basically you're gonna take your right leg and it's gonna come over the front, and then it's gonna go 'round the back, and then over the front again. But then, to do it at pace, you have to put a bit of a skip in there. \n\nThe next phase of the fantastic four is four hurdle drills. Hurdles might seem a bit daunting at first, but they're really not. They're great for core control, and coordination. We're not gonna do these at speed, we're gonna do them all pretty much at walking pace. First thing's first, you wanna get it to the right height, so if you've not used hurdles before, I suggest putting it onto the bottom row... To make sure you can actually get over it.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/5k\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  GTN's Ultimate Brick Workout - http://gtn.io/brickworkout\nüìπ  Retro Vs.
