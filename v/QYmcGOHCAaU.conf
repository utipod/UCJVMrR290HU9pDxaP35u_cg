description = "This is the GTN show, welcome. With just one big race left to go this season, we're going to be looking ahead at the XTERRA World Championships as well as covering news from a recent study that may change the way that you run on a treadmill.\n\nSome amazing performances which leads us on to our weekly poll. Yeah, I mean, we were blown away by Patrick Lange's performance. He's getting ever so close to breaking that eight hour mark which is why we asked last week, will the eight hour mark ever be broken by the men? And we have some results here for you. We do, and it was a pretty large percent of you who said yes, it will, 97% are sure that it's going to be broken. This week, we are interested to find out which world title means the most to you guys. \n\nThis weekend, we have the final triathlon world championships of the season, and all eyes head back to Hawaii but this time to the island of Maui for the XTERRA World Champs.\n\nWell, I mean, the one to beat has to be Flora Duffy. She's the three times winner out there and she's recently crowned ITU world champion and she has managed to mix in some mountain bike training throughout her season, and that's, you know, what is so key for the XTERRA, is the skills on the mountain bike. So, I mean, she's by far the one that everyone's going to be watching, but Leslie Patterson could give her a run for her money, she's gonna be starting there for the eighth time, and out of seven starts, she's actually had four second places and two wins, so pretty consistent on the island.\n\nWell, we've got the top seven finishers from last year competing again, so, again, seriously competitive. And of those seven, we've also got two finishers from the men's pro field in Kona. We got Ben Hoffman, who came ninth in Kona and actually seventh in Maui last year. Also, we got Braden Currie, who's gonna be doubling up for the first time. \n\nAccording to the University of Nottingham Trent and the University of Valencia, they have discovered that by running on a treadmill and looking at something, like a TV in your gym instead of looking naturally just ahead of you, changes the position and the style that you're running in, and it makes you higher, and then apparently you're lifting your feet higher as a result, and therefore, more impact on your joints, it's your ankles and knees.\n\nIf you enjoyed episode 11 of the GTN Show don't forget to give it a like and share with your triathlon friends!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3i\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/3e\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nHeather's Kona Vlog üìπ  http://gtn.io/3g\nOur guide to trail running üìπ  http://gtn.io/3f\n\nThank you for to Xterra for the footage used in this video.\n\n1.\nIRONMAN¬Æ and IRONMAN 70.3¬Æ are registered trademarks of the World Triathlon Corporation.\nImages from IRONMAN¬Æ events are courtesy of the following:\n(Charlie Crowhurst)/Getty Images for IRONMAN\n(Charlie Crowhurst)/IRONMAN\n\n2.\nIRONMAN¬Æ and IRONMAN 70.3¬Æ are registered trademarks of the World Triathlon Corporation.\nImages from IRONMAN¬Æ events are courtesy of the following:\n(Nigel Roddis)/Getty Images for IRONMAN\n(Nigel Roddis)/IRONMAN\n\n3.\nIRONMAN¬Æ and IRONMAN 70.3¬Æ are registered trademarks of the World Triathlon Corporation.\nImages from IRONMAN¬Æ events are courtesy of the following:\n(Stephen Pond)/Getty Images for IRONMAN\n(Stephen Pond)/IRONMAN\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
