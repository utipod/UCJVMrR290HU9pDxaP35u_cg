description = "A good swim recce is crucial to feeling comfortable at the start of a triathlon. Here are GTN's top tips on how to complete a course recce like a pro!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/2d\n\nThere is more to a swim recce than just swimming the course. Race day adrenaline can make common sense go out the window and lead to mistakes being made. A good swim recce can reduce the chance of this and will help you know exactly where the swim buoys are!\n\nThe first buoy: You want to start off with confidence knowing exactly where the buoy is. It may help by sighting a large object such as a boat that is behind this first buoy.\n\nThe run in: If it's a beach start you may want to check the swim entry for rocks, drop off and the gradient. This will . help you make a decision as to where to dive in and begin swimming.\n\nNavigating buoy: In a swim recce it is a good idea to stop at each buoy, orientate yourself and check out exactly where the next buoy is and the angle of the turn.\n\nSwim exit: This can often be hard to spot so try and sight a large object on the shore, this could be a building, tower or ever a large tree!\n\nFinally, you want to consider the conditions. Will the sun be in your eyes? Is there a current? These will vary race to race and therefore are worth thinking about before starting.\n\nGood luck with your next race and let us know how you get on in the comments below üëá\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nGuitar Drone Nr 14 - Jack Elphick\nBrooklyn Flava 3 STEMS DRUMS\nBrooklyn Flava 3 - Mattias Andreasson\nRotations 2 - Jack Elphick\nDriving In The Dark - Andreas Jamsheree\nContraband - Christian Nanzell\nAshes - Johan Borjesson\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/2e\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  9 Open Water Swim Tips For Beginners - http://gtn.io/OpenWater\nüìπ  How To Swim Fast Around Buoys - http://gtn.io/SwimBuoys\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
