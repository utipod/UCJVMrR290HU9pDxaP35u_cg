We thought we challenge our presenters run pacing skills by seeing if they can run 10k without their watches! Think you can do better, have a go yourself! üôå\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/De\n\nHow reliant do you think you are on technology when it comes to running and navigation? We are putting Mark, Heather & Fraser to the test; can you run a 10k without a watch?\n\nAnd no cheating! The rules are: NO well-known routes, it must include hills and of course you can not even have a stopwatch or a map! Cover your watch. Press start and run until you think you‚Äôve covered 10k. Press stop and before you reveal the distance, and for the chance of bonus points guess your time and elevation gain too. \n\nThe closest presenter to the 10k marker wins.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/Dd\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ GTN Lanzarote Hill Climb Challenge üëâ https://gtn.io/CyclistVsRunner\nüìπ GTN Vs Ironman Lanzarote üëâ https://gtn.io/LanzaRecord\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nES_Illuminator - Locus Clouds\nES_Jenna - Another Notion\nES_Need You Back (Instrumental Version) - Milva\nES_Out Of Her Mind (Instrumental Version) - Parellite\nES_Odmjuk - Smartface\nES_Physical (Instrumental Version) - Parellite\nES_Suffer City Blues (Instrumental Version) - Suffer City\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
