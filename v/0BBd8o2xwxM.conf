description = "Now that you have built some fitness across all three disciplines, it's time to progress them further and start thinking about the specific course that you‚Äôll be racing on. We are in to weeks 5 and 6 of training for your first triathlon and this is part three of our ‚ÄòHow To Train For Your First Triathlon‚Äô series.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/82\n\nSwimming - \nIf your already up to swimming around 1000m in a session and first triathlon is a super-sprint or even a sprint distance, then there is little need to increase the total distance of your swim sessions. With it being your first triathlon, your main aim is to complete the triathlon comfortably. So, your focus should now be placed on completing longer reps, and gradually working up to a single rep equal to the swim distance in the triathlon, whilst maintaining your two swims per week.\n\nCycling - \nOn the bike, it‚Äôs time to start thinking about the course for your first triathlon. If possible, do a little research into the route and terrain by looking on the event website, or asking someone that has done it before. Then you can then start tailoring your training to suit that course. If it‚Äôs a hilly course, for example, then you can start including more hills into your rides. Perhaps even try to find a hill that matches the gradient of those on the course. This will make a big difference on race day and make you feel much more comfortable on the bike. \n\nRunning - \nWith your running, it‚Äôs time to start including some brick sessions! This is a term used for running off the bike, and preparing you for race day. Start off short with these brick session runs. Try doing a 10-15minute run off one of your bike sessions per week to begin with. You‚Äôll likely have the feeling heavy legs and that‚Äôs totally normal but in doing these, it will gradually get easier. \n\nThis phase is all about preparing for the event, and starting to look beyond just training and getting fitter.  \n\nAnd finally, don‚Äôt forget to enjoy yourself üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/81\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Train For Your First Triathlon - http://gtn.io/TrainForFirstTri\nüìπ How To Run Off The Bike  - http://gtn.io/brickworkout\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nAmphibian STEMS INSTRUMENTS - Christian Nanzell\nCastle To Ruin (Instrumental Version) STEMS BASS - Martin Hall\nDon't Know It Yet - Aldenmark Niklasson\nNow We Do It Again - Martin Hall\nPink And Blue - oomiee\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
