description = "This is my C√©rvelo P2, which I had the chance to ride on a shoot in Mallorca. I also got to race on it in Chattanooga at the World Championships. I actually only got on a time-trial bike for the first earlier this year, and rode another bike for a couple of months. I then got on this one, and I was amazed at how smooth it felt and how easy to ride, and it's also pretty slick and understated. I genuinely really love this bike. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5G\n\nIt's a 51-inch frame, and attached to that, we've got profile-designed T2 Wing Aero base bars, and then the Profile-designed T4 Plus Aero bars. \n\nOn the end of those, we've got the shifters for the Shimano Ultegra DI2. So I'm using Shimano Ultegra front and rear Derailleurs then Shimano Dura-Ace chain ring at 52/36, which was quite helpful for getting up the big climb in Chattanooga and then an 11/28 cassette on the back. \n\nAs you can see, it's using the Quarq Power Metre, and it's the very first time I've ever ridden with power, so racing with it was quite a new experience obviously I didn't need to look at the numbers going up the hill but for the rest of it, it was really interesting, and I managed to stick to my plan pretty well. I've got 172.5 length cranks on the end of those, the Shimano Ultegra pedals. As you can see, I put Shimano 105 rim brakes on the front, and the back.\n\nI'm using the Vision Metron wheels, got the 55SL on the front, and the 81SL on the back, and then on those, running the Continental Gran Prix tyres, at 25 MM wide, and for Chattanooga, I put in a pressure of 190 because the roads were a little bit rough in places. \n\nFor Cevelo Aero seat posts, and then on top of the is the ISM Adamo Prologue split-nosed saddle, and it's actually the first time I've ever ridden a split nose saddle, and compared to the time-trial bike I was on previously, this is so comfortable, I genuinely feel like I can ride this bike all day with no discomfort. As we're talking about comfort, you can see that I've still got space left in my position isn't that aggressive, but being pretty new to time-travel bikes this year, I very much wanted to be comfortable and feel confident on the bike and then be able to have that consistent power that I needed to target. \n\nWell as you can see since Chattanooga, I have actually given the bike a bit of a clean, removed all the extra bits, but I stored my spares behind the saddle for the race day, and then I actually use profile-designed Aero bottoms for my Aero bars at the front, and then I had a bottlecage on the downtube, but there's also options on this bike to have a storage box on the top for any of you nutrition. \n\nFor you weight weenies out there, it comes in at 8.9 KGs, and just remember though, there are none of the extras on this at the moment, but going through my bike for this pro bike has made me realise how much I love the P2 and I think I should get back out on it, I just need the weather to get a little bit nicer.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/5H\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Mark Threlfall's Cervelo P5X Presenter Bike - http://gtn.io/MTPresenterbike\nüìπ  Ironman 70.3 World Championships Vlog - http://gtn.io/ChatVlog\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
