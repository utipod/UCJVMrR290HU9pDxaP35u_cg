title = "Matt Bottrill's Microburst Interval Cycling Workout | As Done By Lucy Charles & Tim Don"
description = "Matt Bottrill is the bike coach for many of the top triathletes including Lucy Charles, Tim Don & Will Clarke & it's not all about Ironman pace efforts. One workout they all do are some very short, high intensity sprint intervals.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/iQ \n\nMicroburst intervals to help raise the athletes FTP (how much power they can produce before flooding with lactate). These can be anywhere between 10s up to 30s and they‚Äôre basically all-out efforts.\nUnlike steady-state lactate threshold workouts, microburst intervals work primarily by challenging your body to quickly and repeatedly recover from high intensity muscle fatigue.\n\nCheck out this example workout below:\n\n10mins Zone 2\n---\n4x 10secs Zone 6 (sub-maximal)\n5mins Zone 2 recovery between efforts - cadence 100+\n---\n4x 20secs Zone 6 (sub-maximal)\n5mins Zone 2 recovery between efforts - cadence 100+\n---\n4x 30secs Zone 6 (sub-maximal)\n5mins Zone 2 recovery between efforts - cadence 100+\n---\n6mins Cool down - high cadence\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/iP\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Cycle Faster For Free With Time Trial Specialist Matt Bottrill - https://gtn.io/CycleFasterForFree\nüìπ Triathlon Vs.
