title = "7 Resistance Band Exercises | Strength and Conditioning For Triathlon"
description = "Strength training isn't just about throwing big weights around. It's also important to work on those finer movements that activate muscles, and give you control and stability around your joints. Which is where this thing comes in. The theraband, or resistance band. \n\nNow it may not look like much, but it does a heck of a lot. And the nice thing with it is, it's cheap, and it's easy to take anywhere you like. Now, you may have seen these before in a variety of different colours. And that's not for looks. It's actually for varying resistance. So here are a few useful exercises that you can do with a theraband for triathlon. Okay, let's start with some shoulder exercises. These will help to prevent that dreaded swimmer's shoulder, as well as improve the catch and pull phase of your stroke. Simply loop the theraband around the door handle or rail, as I am. Stand back to put some tension in the band. And now you can perform some exercises. \n\nFirst up, we have the rotator cuff exercise. Stand tall with your shoulders set back to a neutral position. Holding the theraband, bring your elbow directly out to the side, and in line with your shoulder. Start with your forearm parallel to the ground, then rotate your forearm as far as you can to vertical. Make sure it's a slow and controlled movement. Then, rotate your arm back down to the starting position. A good starting point is two or three sets of 10 repetitions on each arm. \n\nMoving on, now for a similar exercise. The external shoulder rotation. Stand side-on with your elbow tight to your side at a 90 degree angle. Again, we're going to make controlled movement out to the side, as far as you can, without losing form. Perform 10 reps, then switch arms, and repeat through two to three times. \n\nNext up, we're gonna switch things around, and do the internal shoulder rotation. It's the same controlled movement, but this time inwards. Gonna start with our hand facing outwards, and we're gonna rotate inwards as far as we can, in a controlled movement. Again, perform 10 reps, then switch your arm, and repeat through two to three times. \n\nThe clam exercise focuses on your glute muscles, which actually tend to be the cause of a lot of lower limb injuries. The issue is, when the glutes are too weak, or simply don't activate. Which is hardly a surprise considering most of us spend a whole day at work, sat at a desk, very rarely using our glutes. To do a clam, you need to lie on your side, knees bent, and soles of your feet in line with your spine. Make sure your hips are level, and not tilted too far forward or backwards. Now, perform a clam by lifting your upper knee by using the glute muscle. Lift the knee as high as you can with control, whilst holding your form. \n\nNow for the lateral walk, which is also called the monster walk, and you'll see why. Loop the band just above your knees, or just above your ankles. Keep your back straight, but put a slight bend in your knees. Now start to step laterally, always keeping tension through the band. And then repeat back the opposite direction. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/49\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/4a\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Trail Running Tips For Beginners - http://gtn.io/Trailrunning\nüìπ  8 Key Stretches For Triathletes - http://gtn.io/8Stretches\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
