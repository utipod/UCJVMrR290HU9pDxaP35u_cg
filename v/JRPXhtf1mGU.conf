title = "The Longest Day! | Can We Climb The Welsh 3 Peaks In One Day?"
description = "Snowdon, Cadair Idris and Pen y Fan are the three highest mountains in Wales, and we thought it would be a good idea to climb all three in one day. Not content to cap the challenge there, we decided to cycle the 224 km route traversing the Welsh countryside and connecting the three peaks. There are 17 hours between sunrise and sunset. The race is on.\n\nIn association with Wahoo ðŸ‘‰ https://gtn.io/Wahoo\n\nUseful Links\nSubmit your Photo and Video to us ðŸ‘‰ https://gtn.io/UPLOAD\nCheck out the GTN Shop ðŸ‘‰ https://gtn.io/TeamKit\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nðŸ“¹  Watch our Editorâ€™s Choice Playlist ðŸ‘‰  https://gtn.io/editorschoice \nðŸ“¹  Watch our weekly show, The GTN Show ðŸ‘‰  https://gtn.io/GTNshowPlaylist \n\nPhotos: Â© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nðŸŽµ Music - licensed by Epidemic Sound \nA Cloud Beneath - Lama House\nAstral Roar - Lama House\nBeautiful Life - Rain Jewels\nBelow Horizon - Luwaks\nEnd of an Era - Christoffer Moe Ditlevsen\nEnergized Morning - Airae\nFansi Pan - Yomoti\nFever Dreams - Dylan Sitts\nHeadphones (Instrumental Version) - Ooyy\nLuminescence - Trevor Kowalski\nMountain Spring High - Gabriel Lewis\nNone of the Above - Issue AB\nOstinato - Vieveri\nParadigm Shift - Gavin Luke\nRevolt - Luwaks\nShould I Let Go_ - oomiee\nTen Eleven - Luwaks\nThe Gordian Knot - Jakob Ahlbom\nThe Longest Run - They Dream By Day\nTimeless Clouds - Luwaks\nWe All Need Adventures - Howard Harper-Barnes\nWind Storm 1 - SFX Producer\n\n#gtn #triathlon #swimbikerun #swim #bike #run  [Insert appropriate Hashtags here]\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
