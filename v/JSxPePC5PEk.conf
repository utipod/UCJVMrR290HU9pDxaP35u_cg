title = "Lucy Charles' Specialized S-Works Shiv Pro Triathlon Bike"
description = "This is the Specialized S-Works Shiv of Lucy Charles. Lucy stepped on to the pro circuit a couple of years ago and I think it's fair to say she has turned the heads of every pro, every spectator, every bystander as she's gone on to win Ironman races, she's set bike course records. She even, at the end of last year, came second at the Ironman World Champs in Kona.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/6I\n\nFirst of all we need to talk about this paint work. It looks very similar to Specialized's Torch paintwork that they released before the Rio Olympic Games. Sadly, it's not, but it's still very cool. It's what they call the Rocket Red and Neon Yellow.\n\nShe's riding a small frame, and you're probably wondering why it's got a rather large downtube. Inside here, is a bladder that you store your hydration in. She's got Shimano's fully integrated aero stem and handlebars with a few customizations. The elbow rests are from Revolver and the reason they're cupped is to allow you to get into an aggressive position and rest your elbows into the back of the pads. Off of that we have quite a strong angled ski-bend normally using Drag2Zero bars.\n\nLucy has Shimano Dura-Ace DI2 gears on the poles and bullhorns. Moving back through the bike and she has got the Rotor 2INpower power meter chain set and on those she's got the Rotor Qarbon Q-Rings and interestingly she's riding a 53/36 chainring set up. She's got a 170 crank clank and on the end of those she's got the Shimano Ultegra pedals but she did say for race day she normally has Shimano Dura-Ace. As I've already mentioned, she has got Shimano Dura-Ace DI2 and it is the 9150 groupset. Then on the back she's got the Dura-Ace cassette in an 11/25.\n\nYou might have noticed this CeramicSpeed oversized pulley wheel system and she's also got the CeramicSpeed bottom bracket bearings and headset bearings. The wheels are the Rapide CLX 64 Rapide wheels with pretty bling decals on. These were given to her just before the Ironman World Champs and then on those she's got the S-Works Turbo clincher tyre. They've got this cotton sidewall which not only looks really cool, Specialized also claim it is actually their lowest rolling resistance tyre to date. She's riding a 24mm width on the front and then a 26mm on the back and her bike is also kitted out with Specialised Aero side-pull brakes.\n\nSpecialized also give you a couple of options with the seat post. It comes in a 12.5mm or a 37.5mm setback. So Lucy's currently riding a 12.5mm setback so that she can get nicely forward into an aggressive position and to help that she's also got the ISM PN 1.0 saddle which is a split nose saddle, allows her to get nicely forward on the saddle and tilt her hips round. And then on the back of that she's got the XLab Gorilla cage which has a nice tight grip to hold the bottle in well and then on the seat tube she also has the Xlab Chimp cage.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/6H\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Jonny Brownlee's Scott Foil Pro Bike - http://gtn.io/JBrownleeBike\nüìπ  5 Pro Swim Tips With Lucy Charles - http://gtn.io/SwimFastLucyCharles\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
