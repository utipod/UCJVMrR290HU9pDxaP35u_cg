description = "I headed north to Glasgow for the ETU European Sprint Triathlon Championships and this time it wasn‚Äôt purely for work, I was actually racing too. Follow my build up and race day experience as I represent Great Britain for the first time ever in triathlon. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/dc\n\nRewind to a few months earlier; I entered my first sprint triathlon, in Nottingham, UK. (Yes admittedly I‚Äôve done things backwards with a full IM last year.) This was a European qualifying event and winning my age group gave me the opportunity to represent my country at the European Championships. \n\nWith the European‚Äôs being hosted in Glasgow, Scotland I jumped at the chance of wearing my first ever GB tri suit and competing on home soil in the UK. And then there was the added bonus of having the professional European Triathlon Championships taking place alongside, so plenty of opportunities to learn from the pros.\n\nI flew up North a few days earlier to get some videos filmed with GTN as well as starting my race day preparation. During this vlog I share my thoughts and feelings on the build up; starting from my arrival, to the building of my bike, the course recce, as well as my expectations. \n\nThen it‚Äôs on to race day where I share the preparation right from my waking moment up to the race start. Following that of course there‚Äôs the race itself and I finish off my bringing you my round up on what turned out to be an emotional but hugely successful day.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/db\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Do A Flying Mount | Can Heather Learn From A Pro Triathlete? - http://gtn.io/FlyingMount\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nAll The Right Moves - Gavin Luke\nCrosses 2 - Niklas AhlstroÃàm\nDream Season - Yomoti\nHer Majesty 3 - Victor Olsson\nLight Bulb Screw 3 - SFX Producer\nLight Up The Sky (Instrumental Version) - Wildson\nMail Box Insert 1 - SFX Producer\nMoments Of Contemplation 1 - Magnus Ringblom\nNerdy But Cool Beat 1 - Jonatan JaÃàrpehag\nNordic Poptastic 2 - Jack Elphick\nPettles - Frook\nRope Twist Heavy 3 - SFX Producer\nSo Many Clouds - oomiee\nSummer Sports 5 - BjoÃàrn Skogsberg\nTo Bright - Mochas\nWonder Of A Child - Johannes BornloÃàf\nWood Twist Handle 3 - SFX Producer\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
