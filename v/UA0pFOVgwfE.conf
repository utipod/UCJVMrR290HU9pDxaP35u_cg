title = "Improve Your Open Water Confidence | 8 Beginner Swimming Tips For Triathletes"
description = "It‚Äôs amazing how many triathletes, even strong swimmers, are scared of open water swimming. Overcoming your fears will benefit your whole triathlon performance. So we have 8 tips that will make you more confident in open water. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7a\n\nGTN's top tips to improve your confidence in open water include...\n\nAcknowledge Your Fears\nIt‚Äôs natural to have a little fear of open water as it is the unknown. Figure out exactly what it is that scares you; is it the dark murky water, or is it the chop on the surface? Once you‚Äôve identified your fear you can then begin to address that specifically. \n\nChallenge Your Fears\nTake yourself to a safe environment that you feel confident in such as your local pool and then replicate the similar open water situation that gets you worried. For example if your fear is deep dark water like myself start by using some extra dark tinted goggles, swim with your eyes closed or try and find a deep diving pool to practise in. \n\nPreparation\nBefore getting wet make sure you have all the kit to help you. I feel safer in a full arm and leg wetsuit plus you have the added buoyancy. It‚Äôs worth having a buoy marker you can attach around your waste that makes you very visible from the shore as well as doubling up as a buoyancy if you want a break.\n\nAcclimatisation\nWhen you first get to an open water venue take a moment to get your bearings and work out where everything is. Once you‚Äôre happy, get into the water slowly, giving your body time to adjust to the temperature whilst keeping your breathing relaxed. \n\nHave fun\nAs triathletes we spend most of our time focused and training. Water is seen as a training venue but taking a moment to relax and enjoy the environment can have significant benefits. Get used to the feeling of being weightless, especially when you‚Äôre in your wetsuit, take a breath, lie on your back and relax.\n\nIf you found this video helpful, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share with your triathlon friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/79\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nLight In Water 4 - Jonatan JaÃàrpehag\nShark Waters - Magnus Ringblom\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ 9 Open Water Swimming Tips | Swim Skills For Beginners - http://gtn.io/OpenWater\nüìπ How To Choose Your First Triathlon Event - http://gtn.io/ChooseYourFirstTriathlon\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
