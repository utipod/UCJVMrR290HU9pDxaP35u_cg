title = "Does Altitude Training Really Work? | The GTN Show Ep. 31"
description = "In the triathlon world this week, weâ€™re talking altitude training, swimming technology and indoor training. We have the announcement of the winners for our Park Tool competition along with the latest triathlon racing news from the Mooloolaba World Cup and Ironman 70.3 Bariloche.\n\nDon't forget the GTN Show is for every triathlete, swimmer, cyclist and runner!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/80\n\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nOur main discussion this week is around altitude training. Many top triathlon pros train at altitude regularly, and in fact, many sleep in altitude tents and rooms if they donâ€™t live at altitude. But why? Does it really have that much of an advantage on our performance? \n\nTo explore this we look at an incredible study performed by Professor Mike Grocott and his team. They took blood samples and muscle biopsies from Sherpas on the side of Everest and compared this to regular people. The results were fascinating!\n\nAlso on the show this week, we discuss:\n- A limited edition Lamborghini Cervelo P5X\n- The SwimAR holographic\n- Relays at Ironman Mont Tremblant\n- South African triathlete, Mhlengi Gwala's recovery\n- Mooloolaba World Cup\n- Ironman 70.3 Bariloche\n\nAs well as the latest in all things triathlon, we have our usual segments such as the #GTNPainCave, #GTNTRIBE and CAPtion competition.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/7-\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nðŸ“¹ Barefoot Running | GTN Investigates The Pros And Cons - http://gtn.io/BarefootRunning\nðŸ“¹ 5 Things Triathletes Can Learn From Road Cyclists - http://gtn.io/LearnFromCyclists\n\nPhotos: Â© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers â€“ and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, weâ€™re here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTubeâ€™s best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
