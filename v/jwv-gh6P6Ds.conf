description = "This week on our Triathlon Training Explained show, we are discussing all things overtraining! We will be looking at the causes, symptoms and how to recover.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/8I\n\nIn association with Training Peaks - http://gtn.io/TrainingPeaks\n\nAs triathletes we are constantly trying to find that perfect balance between training hard and getting faster and stronger, with recovery. We are guilty of it, and sometimes cut down rest and recovery a little more than we probably should, in order to fit in all our training around the working week. \n\nWe tend to push ourselves to the limit as triathletes, but ignoring recovery and signs that you‚Äôre overtraining can be pretty devastating... trust us. It‚Äôs also a confusing area, are you just tired from training, or are you on the verge of overtraining? \n\nWe‚Äôve had loads of questions around this topic. So we‚Äôre going to be exploring this in more detail and chat to the following experts on the matter: \n- Dan Harris - GB Rowing Start Coach\n- Matt Bottrill - Triathlon and Cycling Coach\n- Nathan Lewis - EIS Nutritionist\n- Sarah Bolt - Forth, Blood Testing\n\nFor more information on this topic, check out the following links from training peaks:\n- All About Overtraining - http://gtn.io/TPOvertraining\n- How Long Does it Take to Recover From Overtraining? - http://gtn.io/RecoverOvertraining\n- How Monitoring Your Heart Rate Variability Helps You Avoid Overtraining - http://gtn.io/TPHRVOvertraining\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/8H\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Triathlon Training Explained | How To Structure Your Training Plan - http://gtn.io/TriathlonTrainingExplained\nüìπ Training Strategies When You Have No Time | Train Around Work Or Study - http://gtn.io/TrainWithNoTime\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
