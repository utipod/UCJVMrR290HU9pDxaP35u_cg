description = "Supplements can be a great way to help improve your triathlon training and racing performance whilst meeting your body's nutritional requirements.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/dR\n\nWith such a huge array of supplements to choose from and all of the manufacturers doing their best to convince you that you need their product it can be difficult to know where to start. How do you know if you need to take a supplement? That‚Äôs a tough question. \nIn the ideal world you‚Äôd have a blood test but that‚Äôs not a realistic option for most of us, so beyond that it is a bit of trial and error.\n\nStart by looking at your diet. If you have a normal healthy and balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and do just a small amount of training then there should be no need to supplement your diet. If however, you are putting your body through a lot of stress for example training for an IM or you do not get a good balance from your food then supplements could help make up that nutritional deficit. \n\nIn this video, Heather explains a little more detail about what a supplement is and goes through her top picks that can help you improve your triathlon training and racing performance. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/dQ\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Lose Weight Through Triathlon | 8 Weight Loss Tips For Triathletes - http://gtn.io/LoseWeight\nüìπ What's Your Pre-Race Breakfast? | GTN Ask The Pros - http://gtn.io/Preracebreakfast\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nMachine - Lvly\nMade By Man 2 - Anders BotheÃÅn\nRotations - Friends With Animals\nThe Night Feeling Suave - Friends With Animals\nThe Wax Cabinet 3 - Niclas Gustavsson\nWreak Havoc 01 - HaÃäkan Eriksson\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
