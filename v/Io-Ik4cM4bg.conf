description = "It seems that every sport has its own code of etiquette. And swimming is among those sports, though the "rules" are pretty easy to pick up. Just follow our essential swim etiquette and you will be fine!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/cm\n\nMuddy legs - It can be tricky training for a triathlon. Trying to fit in three different sports, tends to leave us with very little time, and rushing everywhere.
