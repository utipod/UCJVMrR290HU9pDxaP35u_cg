This is no ordinary event. It lures you in, it chews you up, and it spits you out. \n\nTo give you a little taste of Norseman, Zwift are running a 6 week-long series of events to see if you have got what it takes to tackle a Norseman-type challenge. Naturally, there is a lot of climbing in these events, but this particular event is quite special. \n\nThe Norseman Viking Challenge.\n\nOver 350 athletes have signed up to this event up Alpe du Zwift, where they will be chased by 2 fierce Vikings - the current Ironman 70.3 World Champion, Gustav Iden, and current Ironman 70.3 record holder, Kristian Blummenfelt - who will both be heading out of the start pen 15mins behind the other athletes.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Are Triathletes Better Than Cyclists? üëâ  https://gtn.io/GTNvsGCNzwift\nüìπ  GTN Vs The Norseman Xtreme Triathlon  üëâ  https://gtn.io/NorsemanGTN\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nES_Hold the Gates - Dream Cave\nES_Seeking the Divine - Edward Joe Myers\nES_Come 2gether - Ooyy\nES_Olympos - Ooyy\nES_Organic Bijou - Ooyy\nES_Heart & Soul (Instrumental Version) - Blood Red Sun\nES_Wild Birds - Marc Torch\nES_Shleepy - Timothy Infinite\nES_Linearity - Jobii\nES_Bermuda - Ooyy\nES_You've Definitely Had Your Moments - Sarah, the Illstrumentalist\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
