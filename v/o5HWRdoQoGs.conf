If you are still relatively new to using cleats you are likely to be more conscious of your pedal stroke and possibly guilty of still just pushing down. The advantage of clipless pedals mean you can make the circle more continuous. \n\nIf you watch the pro‚Äôs, their pedal stroke looks smooth, the power is not purely on the down phase but also part of the backwards phase. It is often described as scraping back and down. Then think of lifting your knees, realistically you won‚Äôt be pulling up but it does help to picture that smooth circle. \n\nYou also want to avoid stomping on the pedals as this is wasting energy with excessive movement and relying purely on your quad muscles. The whole time picture trying to draw a circle with the transition from one leg to the other being seamless. \n\nAs well as your pedal stroke, we look at your position on the bike, cadence and drills you can do to help!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/am\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ 5 Core Exercises To Make Yourself Stronger - http://gtn.io/5CoreExercises\nüìπ What Is The Optimal Cycling Cadence For You To Run Faster Off The Bike? - http://gtn.io/OptimalCadence\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nMad Woman (Instrumental Version) - Lvly\nSlamming Stoners 10 (Sting Version) - Victor Olsson\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
