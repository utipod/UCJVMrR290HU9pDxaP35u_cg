title = "HIIT Style Workout For Triathletes | Stay Fit When You Have To Train Indoors"
description = "It can be frustrating if you're feeling super fit and healthy heading into Christmas, and then your local pool is closed, the roads are too icy to go cycling or running, and you're surrounded by unhealthy treats and snacks. But if all else fails, there is something you can do to compensate, and you can start by following this HIIT style session we designed specifically for triathletes. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5C\n\nAll you need to do is clear a bit of space in your home, and if you've got someone else around, why not get a friend or family member to join in and make it a little bit more fun. \n\nWe'll start with skipping, which is a pretty straightforward exercise, and it's great for getting your heart rate up and your body warm ahead of the rest of the exercises. Now, try and focus on something on the wall in front of you. Keep your chin nice and high. You want to keep your shoulders level. And the idea is, you're bouncing on your toes, trying to make quite a small movement, but speed it up and try to maintain that speed for the whole one minute. \n\nFor this exercise, you need a step and just a little bit of space. We're going to split it in two, so the first 30 seconds, you're going to work one leg, and the second 30 seconds, the other. And the whole point of this exercise is to work on your hip drive, so it's great for running. And the idea, you want to think you're driving your hips forwards and up with each step. \n\nSo to start with, you're going to lift up your right foot, for example, and then place it in a fairly quick movement onto the step and drive up through that hip, bringing your other leg to 90 degrees, using your arm in parallel. Then, as you step down, you're going to lift this foot just off the step to 90 degrees, back down, and drive again, really remembering, keeping your hips square, facing forwards, and keeping really good posture, and thinking of the driving forwards. \n\nThis is an explosive movement. It's a plyometric exercise that's going to help your glutes to really start firing, and it's great for making you more reactive when it comes to the run. So basically, you're going to be driving up onto the box, landing with both feet together, knees bent. From there, you're going to step back down. Make sure you alternate which leg you step back down with, 'cause that's eccentric loading in itself, and you're going to try to maintain really good form for the full minute, and you'll find your heart rate will really go through the roof by the end. \n\nThis exercise is quite like speed skating, and you actually see the speed skaters using this in their strength and conditioning. So it's a diagonally forward-sideways hop. So you're going to be driving from the supporting leg, so in this situation, I'm going to the right diagonally forward, so I'm driving off my left, and the idea is you land solidly on your right leg.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/5D\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  7 Resistance Band Exercises For Triathlon - http://gtn.io/7bandexercises\nüìπ  How To Ride In The Wind - http://gtn.io/rideinwind\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
