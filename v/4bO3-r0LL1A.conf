title = "Tri Suit Vs Swimskin | What Triathlon Swim Kit Should You Race In?"
description = "As a triathlete, you might wear in a tri suit or a swimskin if the water is too warm for a wetsuit! But which is faster? And which should you wear for your next triathlon?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/gQ\n\nIf the water is above a certain temperature, wetsuits are not allowed during a triathlon. The temperature varies between organisations but Ironman, for example, have a cut off of 24.5 degrees Celsius for age group athletes. In this case, swimwear is not allowed to consist of any neoprene. The swimwear must also not come past your elbows or knees.\n\nThat leaves it open to anything from a bikini to something more advanced like a tri suit or a swimskin. But which of these should you wear in your next triathlon?!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/gP\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Pool Swim Stroke Vs Open Water Triathlon Stroke | How Do They Differ? - https://gtn.io/PoolVOpenWater\nüìπ Tri Suit Vs Wetsuit - Which Is Fastest? | GTN Does Science - https://gtn.io/wetsuittrisuit\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nBreathing Now (Instrumental Version) - Craig Reever.wav\nParaiso (Instrumental Version) - Craig Reever.wav\nChill RnB Soul 5 - Merlean.wav\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
