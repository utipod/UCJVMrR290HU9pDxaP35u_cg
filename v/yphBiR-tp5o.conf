description = "Your swim stroke rate is how many strokes you take per minute. What should this rate be? And how can you improve your front crawl stroke to reach this number?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/hu \n\nStroke rate is important because it affects the rhythm of your stroke and is directly related to the distance you take per stroke in the water.\n\nIf your stroke rate is too slow, it‚Äôs a good indication that there is too much glide between successive strokes. A 'glide' in the stroke slows you down as you need to re-accelerate yourself again with the next stroke - and that's more effort! \n\nIf however, your stroke rate is too fast, it suggests that your arms are slipping through the water and there isn‚Äôt good propulsion coming from a solid catch, pull and push phase of the stroke. Ultimately, this means losing distance per stroke.\n\nTherefore, finding the optimal stroke rate is about the right balance between stroke rate and distance per stroke (and this certainly will be different for each athlete).\n\nWhat is your natural stroke rate?
