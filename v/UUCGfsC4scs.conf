description = "We're looking at training diaries; what they are, what they‚Äôre for and why you should definitely keep one! The benefits of keeping a diary are to show progress or pick apart your performance if things aren't going so well! Mark is here to help you find the best way to track your own training & planning! \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/Bu\n\nWe're looking at training diaries; what they are, what they‚Äôre for and why you should definitely keep one! \n\nA simple training diary can be used to show progress, if you make a note of the training you are doing each day, including the intensity level, paces, and achievements, you can look back and see how far you‚Äôve come over time! \n\nOne of the biggest benefits I have found from keeping a training diary is that I can look back at my training and understand, or at least pick apart, why you might be performing well or not. Perhaps you got your taper totally wrong, or a bike workout three days ago has actually left you struggling for the remainder of the week...or maybe you ate the wrong food prior to a run.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/Bt\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Are You Running Too Fast? üëâ https://gtn.io/RunFastTTE\nüìπ Triathlon Training Explained Playlist üëâ https://gtn.io/TTEPlaylist\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nBeauti Ful - Smartface\nDon't Trip - Amber Spill\nGetting Tipsy - Fox Morrow\nTiny Things - Giants' Nest\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
