description = "This week on the GTN Show, we bring you the latest triathlon news from around the world! We bring you an update on the run course at Challenge Roth, Nike designing shoes using new algorithms and we discuss whether smiling could make you faster!\n\nDon't forget the GTN Show is for every triathlete, swimmer, cyclist and runner!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/6E\n\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nIn last weeks poll we asked whether you prefer swimming in an indoor pool, outdoor pool, or in the open water. The majority of you agreed with Mark that open water swimming is the best. 54% of the votes were for open water, and only 14% of the votes for swimming indoors. This week we ask you what what face you pull whilst racing? Let us know in the comments below and vote in the poll.\n\nOur main discussion in the show this week is whether smiling can make you faster. A study was completed with 24 club level runners. The participants did running tests with a variety of facial expressions and the results showed that on average people were 2.8% faster when smiling. Are you able to stay relaxed and smile whilst racing?\n\nAs we progress towards some of the first big races of the year, there is an increase in triathlon news to bring you from around the world:\n- Results from Ironman 70.3 South Africa.\n- Challenge Roth have updated their run course to make it even faster.\n- Henri Schoeman was cleared of all wrongdoing following our TUE discussion last week.\n- Endura create a custom kit to help support the medical expenses of Ironman record holder Tim Don.\n- Nike are producing personal running shoes using computer algorithms.\n\nAs well as the latest in all things triathlon, we have our usual segments such as the #GTNPainCave and CAPtion competition.\n\nWe hope you enjoy episode 25 of the GTN Show, let us know what you think in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/6D\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Train For Your First Triathlon - http://gtn.io/TrainForFirstTri \nüìπ Pro Swim Tips With Lucy Charles - http://gtn.io/SwimFastLucyCharles\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
