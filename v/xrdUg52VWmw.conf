description = "A while ago, James and Mark thought it would be a good idea to enter the Brighton marathon, it's about time they should start training! James has run a 2:40 before at Challenge Roth... after a 180km bike. Since then though, he's retired from pro triathlon and had plenty of life events that have stopped him from training so he's aiming to work back up to his personal PB. Aaaand Marks attempting the same! \n\nCheck out the Training Plan here: https://gtn.io/230TrainingPlan\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/UA\n\nJoin Mark and James for this series as they work their way through this short training plan to try to accomplish a 2:30 or better time for the Brighton marathon.
