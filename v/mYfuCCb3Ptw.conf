description = "Front crawl swimming can look smooth, fast and effortless. We are continuing to break down the stroke to perfect each stage in order to help you develop your front crawl.  In this video we‚Äôre going to be looking at rotation. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/cd\n\nThe front crawl stroke can be broken into four phases, the catch, the pull, the exit and the recovery. Rotation happens throughout all four and is essential to making the stroke smooth and efficient. You should actually only spend a moment totally horizontal throughout each stroke, when your right hand is underwater and ‚Äúpulling‚Äù you need to rotate up on the left and vice versa. \n\nYou don‚Äôt want to rely purely on your arm strength to pull you through the water, you need to add in full body rotation. Super flexible shoulders might well allow you to have the full range required for swimming but you‚Äôll be losing out on a lot of potential power as well as being more vulnerable to injury. \n\nThe rotation in front crawl should be purely around the longitudinal axis, imagine there is a line going from the top of your head down to your feet and your hips, shoulders and torso all rotate around this, no side to side bending movement should be seen. This will allow you to engage the larger muscles in your back and torso therefore generating far more power on each stroke. \n\nDrills you can do to help with rotation include:\n- Kick rotation\n- One arm extended side kick\n- Six kicks rotate\n- Corkscrew\nCheck out the full video for more on all of these.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/cc\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Breathe When Swimming | Freestyle Swimming For Beginners - http://gtn.io/SwimBreathing\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nSmooth Sailing - Dylan Sitts\nRaspberry - Homebody\nAs Real As It Gets - Matt Large\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
