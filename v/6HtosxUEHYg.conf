title = "Top Triathlon Technology To Make You Go Faster | Tri Tech Of 2017"
description = "As we're coming towards the end of the 2017 season, we thought we'd put together a list of the top tri-tech that will help you to go faster.\n\nSo the best way to make yourself faster is to make yourself as aerodynamic as possible. And the better kit that we saw this year was from Notio Konect, where you attach a small sensor onto the front of your bike, and it gives you your aerodynamic coefficient in real time.\n\nAnd whilst we were out in Kona, we also spotted a similar device by Swiss Side. Basically, they both enable you to have that real-time aerodynamic analysis, making it much more accessible for people. And you don't need to go and find a wind tunnel.\n\nAnd there's a great new product from a company called LEOMO, which essentially gives you an alternative if you're going to get a bike fit done. But this time you can actually go out and get it done in real world conditions, out on the bike, out on the road. So it fits to your bike and off you go. And it measures all your parameters, to basically get you the perfect motion when riding. It's a great training tool as well, so your coach can sort of see it each week. \n\nSo after the success of the 454, Zipp have now brought out the 858's, using the same Sawtooth rim technology, which now means long-distance athletes have got that super deep-section wheel that's incredibly aerodynamic, but also mega with handling in crosswinds.\n\nAnd also this year we saw Nike unveil its Vaporfly 4% shoe, which is a really cool shoe. It's got a carbon insert between two layers of foam in the middle. It claims that you can improve efficiency by 4%, which is really neat. So we've seen it on a few athletes. It was debuted at the Breaking2, the two-hour marathon record attempt. Shalane Flanagan's been pictured wearing it. Terenzo Bozzone in the Island House, I think I saw wearing it. There's even recently been, maybe you could say, proof of exceeding that 4%, 'cause Camille Herron, just a week ago, broke the 100-mile record by over an hour, which apparently is pretty much 8%. \n\nAt Kona this year, we saw Kask launch their new Mistral helmet. We were very lucky to get our hands on one of the Kona specials. Now it's based on the Bambino, it's just got the extra long tail. And it has some cooling vents here at the front, six there, and then two at the back as well. And on top of these, it's got a couple of, well five actually, cooling vents through the front of the visor, which attaches with a nice magnetic click. And when you're not using it, you just pop it on top. \n\nAnother piece of tech launched in Kona this year was the Roka short sleeve swimskin. The advantage of this, you can wear a short sleeve tri suit underneath without having to push it down inside your swimskin, making you more hydrodynamic in the water.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/4m\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/4n\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  New Bike Tech From Kona - http://gtn.io/KonaBikeTech17\nüìπ  Retro vs Modern Running Shoes - http://gtn.io/RetroVModernShoes\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
