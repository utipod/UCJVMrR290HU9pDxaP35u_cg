title = "6 Essential Tools Every Triathlete Should Own"
description = "As triathletes and cyclists, you'll soon realise that your cycling and triathlon kit needs looking after and a little maintenance from time to time! There are a few essential tools that you'll need to look after your kit. So, here is GTN's list of tools that every triathlete should own.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7s\n\nDoing your own bike and tri kit maintenance is a great way to save a bit of cash. You'll have to spend a bit first though, so we put together this list of 6 tools that we think every triathlete needs to own.\n\nThe first one that we're sure many of you already have is a set of Allen Keys or Hex Keys. There are numerous nuts and bolts on bikes that will need adjusting every so often and most of these bolts have 6 contact points - needing our well known 6-sided tool. And, rather than travelling with a handful of different size Allen keys, you can of course get a multi-tool.\n\nNext up is the torque wrench. You will sometimes need to fasten bolts where it‚Äôs really important you don‚Äôt crank them down too much. Over-tightening them can result in cracked carbon or sheared aluminium! For many of the smaller bolts, they don‚Äôt need a huge torque, so you can get away with using a smaller, more portable wrench.\n\nNeoprene glue is a fast and simple way to repair minor cuts or holes in your wetsuit, without sending it off for repair. There can be nothing worse than discovering a hole in your wetsuit the day before a race, perhaps during a course recce. Just small holes or cuts in your suit can risk slowing you down, so if you do spot one, you can simply glue it back together and forget worrying about it!\n\nMark never travels without electrical tape! It comes in handy for things like packing your bike away for travel, taping gels to your frame or a spare tube and CO2 canister for race-day. Mark has even used it for aerodynamic reasons, to tidy cables away and cover small holes.\n\nYou might not think of the foam roller as a tool, but it maintains something fairly important... YOU! Granted, the foam roller isn‚Äôt for everyone, but it can help to keep your muscles in check, relieve any tightness, and even keep some niggles at bay. \n\nIf you found this video helpful, make sure to share it with your triathlon and cycling friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/7r\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nPREL Ascend Digital 6 - SFX Producer\nEkans - Molife (1)\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Use A Foam Roller - http://gtn.io/FoamRoller\nüìπ 6 Tips For Every Travelling Triathlete - http://gtn.io/TravellingTips\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
