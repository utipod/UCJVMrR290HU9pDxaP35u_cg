description = "All triathletes want to look smooth and effortless on the run. Former professional triathlete Mark Threlfall shows you how to run like a pro and shares his key tips to improve your run leg at the end of a triathlon.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/b\n\nWhen you see a pro triathlete on the run it can be hard to believe they have swum and cycled already. In this video watch former professional triathlete Mark Threlfall as he shows you how to run like a pro and transform your technique so that you look smooth and effortless.\n\n- Contact time refers to the amount of time your foot is in contact with the ground. Faster runners generally have a shorter contact time as they are able to transfer power quickly and efficiently. Adding short intervals to your training along with plyometrics can improve this. \n- Another way to improve your running is to run tall. Aligning head, shoulders, hips and legs keeps you tall and balanced and this helps you to utilise big muscle groups and become a more efficient runner.\n- Mark's next tip is to focus on foot placement. Rather than focussing on how your foot lands, try focussing on where your foot lands. Make sure not to over stride and aim for your feet to land beneath your hips.\n- Running with tense shoulders can restrict your breathing and prevent you from running effortlessly. Relax your fingers and drop your shoulders as you run.\n\nFollow these tips and learn to run like a pro!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/c\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  The first ever GTN Show http://gtn.io/TheGTNShow1\nüìπ  4 Swim Workouts For Triathletes http://gtn.io/9 \n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
