title = "How To Run A Fast Half Marathon With GCN's Dan Lloyd"
description = "You‚Äôve done a 5km, a 10km, and perhaps you‚Äôve already done a Half Marathon, but now you‚Äôre looking to do a FAST Half Marathon! Here is GTN's guide to running a fast half marathon with the help of Dan Lloyd from our friends at the Global Cycling Network.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7q\n\nTraining - For a half marathon, threshold and long runs should take a greater importance in your training programme. The threshold run helps the body adapt to clearing lactic acid more efficiently, whilst the long run helps to increase aerobic capacity.\n\nPacing - You can monitor your time through each km. Some people like to write the splits down on their hand and know what time they need to go through 5km, 10km etc. Depending on the time you‚Äôre doing, the races often have pacers running too. Normally with a big banner or flag so that you can spot them.\n\nFuelling - As most races take place in the morning, a big carb-heavy breakfast probably isn‚Äôt the best idea. It's a good idea to fuel well in the couple of days before and the evening before. Not bowls and bowls of carbs, but a good regular size meal to stock those fuel levels up. And to avoid any issues on the run, we normally suggest trying to eat your breakfast around 2.5-3hrs before the race start. \n\nYou may also want to take a gel around the half way or 10 mile mark. It helps as an incentive and energy for that final push. It‚Äôs personal preference so if you don't like gels, you may want to take on another fast releasing carb source. \n\nWarm Up - As a warm up, we suggest heading off for a short 10-20 minute jog. Its a good idea to finish with a few strides of around 50-60 meters building to a fast pace.\n\nIf you found this video useful, don't forget to give it a thumbs up and share it with your triathlon and running friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/7p\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nBounce Back 2 - Jack Elphick\nEkans - Molife\nGo! - Henrik Andersson\nLounge Lizards 1 (Scratch Version) - Jack Elphick\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Run A Fast 5k With GCN's Dan Lloyd - http://gtn.io/Fast5k\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
