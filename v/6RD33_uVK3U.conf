title = "Fit Vs. Healthy | The GTN Show Ep. 22"
description = "This week we bring you the latest triathlon news from around the world, an update on Tim Don's recover, running in prisons and discuss the difference between being fit and healthy. Don't forget the GTN Show is for every triathlete, swimmer, cyclist and runner!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/61 \n\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nIn last weeks poll we asked who you which discipline you will be focussing on in in 2018. It was very close with running just coming out on top with 34% of your votes. This week we ask you which is the toughest multi sport event? Is it triathlon, duathlon or aquathlon?\n\nOur main discussion in the show this week is the difference between being fit, and being healthy. Does being race fit mean sacrificing health, and where is the middle ground? Should we try and copy the pro triathletes? And why do professional athletes differ so much in their body composition? Watch the show to hear our thoughts on all this.\n\nAt this time of year, the triathlon racing is limited to very few races. Instead, we look at the PTO long distance triathlon rankings and the Collins Cup. This is a Ryder Cup style event between Europe, USA and the rest of the world that will take place at Challenge Roth this year. There is also a lot of activity with athletes changing sponsors and teams including current world champion Flora Duffy joining the team at Specialized.\n\nAs well as the latest in all things triathlon, we have our usual segments such as the #GTNPainCave and CAPtion competition.\n\nWe hope you enjoy episode 22 of the GTN Show, let us know what you think in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/63\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Clean Your Running Shoes - http://gtn.io/CleanShoes\nüìπ  How To Breathe When Swimming - http://gtn.io/SwimBreathing\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
