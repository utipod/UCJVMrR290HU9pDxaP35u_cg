description = "Fraser is in Zurich to meet Bart Aernouts at On's headquarters and test out the latest running shoes they have to offer. Find out how running shoes are made along with the testing and development process that gets a new shoe to market!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/qG \n\nIn association with On Running.\n\nA running shoe doesn‚Äôt just arrive in a box ready to go off the shelf in the store. Indeed, there is a small army of people involved in the entire process from start to finish. And key to that process, are the professional athletes themselves that train and race in the shoes.\n\nIn fact, their specific feedback is fundamental in the continual development and improvement of the products that these companies are selling on the market which in turn has a trickle-down effect for you guys - the customers.\n\nSo today we‚Äôve been invited by Bart Aernouts, 2nd place finisher at Ironman Hawaii in 2018, and our channel partner On, to get an insight into the nuts and bolts of that shoe design process, as Bart discusses the shoes with them, here at their headquarters and testing facility in Zurich. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/qF \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Bart Aernouts: From Duathlon To Triathlon | Do You Need To Swim Well To Podium At Kona? - https://gtn.io/BartAernouts\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nAshtrays - Guustavv\nCayman - HDBeenDope\nChangli - Ooyy\nCoara - Lonov \nDansez - Fasion\nExpensive Dinner - SINY\nFar Away Star - Lishuid\nJust Drive (Instrumental Version) STEMS DRUMS - Wellmess\nNobody Else - Swif7\nRise Of The Phoenix - Rannar Sillard\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
