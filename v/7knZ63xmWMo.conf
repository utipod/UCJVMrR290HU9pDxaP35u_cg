title = "Vicky Holland's Specialized S-Works Tarmac Pro Triathlon Bike And Kit"
description = "We are here with the triathlon bike and kit of Rio Olympic Games Bronze Medalist Vicky Holland. She is riding the Specialised S-Works Tarmac in a 52cm frame with a few customisations.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/6h\n\nSo let's start with probably the most obvious customisation on the front end, and that is her bar tape-- where she's got a blue and pink set-up, which came standard from Specialised, apparently, which is pretty cool. And then on the end of that she has the Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 9150 levers. \n\nInterestingly, she also has some clip-on tri bars, which not everyone opts for in ITU racing, given that you cycle in a pack. She's got some Deda arm cuffs here and the Deda clamps. But these are perhaps actually some Zipp bars. I'm saying that because there are some Zipp plugs there. I might be completely wrong. And then, they have to have a bridge on these tri bars. So she's actually got a Profile Design bridge here. \n\nNow, moving on to the wheels-- you're never going to see anything super deep in ITU racing. I mean, you want a bike that's agile, responsive, and you can throw around. So you're going to go for something slightly shallower. So she has the Roval CLX50 Rapide wheels. And then on those she has the S-Works Turbo tubular tyre in a 24mm width.\n\nNow, we don't have the scales here today to weigh the bike, but it's believed the new Tarmac is around 200 grammes lighter than its predecessor. And they've done that through improving the carbon layout and also how much paint is applied to the frame. Now in terms of the aerodynamics, they've changed a few designs in the frame. So you've got this cut-out around the rear wheel, aerodynamic features around the seat tube and the seat post, dropped rear stays and forks that come in a range of sizes.\n\nShe has the S-Works power crank set, which is a dual-sided power metre from Specialised, which is really exciting. It is due to be released at some point in 2018. She's running a 170 crank length. But she has told us that she is playing with the idea of using 165s. But currently she is riding 170s. And on the end today she has the Look KEO blade pedals, and then she's running a 52/36 chainring set-up. And then she obviously has the Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 9150 front mech and rear mech. You have probably noticed the rather large cogs on the back, and that is because she's running the CeramicSpeed OSPW jockey wheels. CeramicSpeed are aiming to improve the flow of the chain through that area by reducing the tight angles. And then that is all connected by this rather flash gold KMC chain. \n\nThen on to some of the finishing touches and componentry. She has the Shimano Dura-Ace brake callipers. And then on top of the S-Works Aero seat post she has the S-Works Power saddle, which she has opted for the smaller 143 mil size. And then she has the S-Works bottle cages.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/6i\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCristaux - Andr√© Aguado (1)\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Weird & Wonderful Bike Tech From The ITU Gran Final In Rotterdam - http://gtn.io/RotterdamTech\nüìπ  Clip On Aero Bars Vs Drops - http://gtn.io/AeroBarsVsDrops\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
