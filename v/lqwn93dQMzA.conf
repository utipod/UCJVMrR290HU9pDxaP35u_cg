title = "Running With Power - Has Run Training & Racing Changed Forever?"
description = "Running power meters are the latest method for runners and triathletes to measure their workload and analyse their efforts. Could this data improve your running forever?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/j1 \n\nRunning power is a measurement of our work output when we run. A running power meter calculates this by measuring our movement in three planes; vertical, horizontal and lateral. It utilises fancy micro accelerometers, some fast computer processing, and some very complicated math to finally compute and calculate that all important power number.\n\nAnd that power is measured in a unit called ‚ÄòWatts‚Äô.The higher the Watts, the more power you‚Äôre generating with every step. And the more power you can generate at a lower heart rate or faster pace, then the more efficient you are. \n\nBeing able to track power is a method that has been used in cycling for decades; allowing cycling to advance, and performances to improve. But technology has since advanced, and sensors are now small enough to make this available to runners too. The big question is... ‚Äòcan it help running in the same way it has cycling?‚Äô\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/j0 \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ GTN Unboxing: NEW Polar Vantage Multisport Watches - https://gtn.io/VantageUnboxing \nüìπ How To Run Using Heart Rate Zones | Running Training For Triathlon - https://gtn.io/RunHRZones\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nWave - [ocean jams]\nTurquoise Waves - Sarah, the Illstrumentalis\nStab Me In The Back - Bonkers Beat Club\nRotations - Friends With Animals\nToo Tired - Smartface\nLeaves - [ocean jams]\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
