title = "Does Coffee Make You Faster? | The GTN Show Ep. 29"
description = "This week weâ€™re talking about the Specialized Zwift Triathlon Academy, the Major League Triathlon Series, and the effects of coffee as opposed caffeine on performance. Weâ€™re also going to be discussing the rather exciting weekend of racing and tell you how you can get your hands on some Park Tool products.\n\nDon't forget the GTN Show is for every triathlete, swimmer, cyclist and runner!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7w\n\nENTER HERE: http://gtn.io/WINParkTool\n\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nOur main discussion this week is the effects of coffee on performance. Most research looks at the effects of pure caffeine consumed as tablets with water whereas in the real world most people get their caffeine from coffee, energy drinks or other products like special gels. So, will drinking a cup of coffee before your workout actually make a difference? \n\nAlso on the show this week, we discuss:\n- Specialized Zwift Triathlon Academy\n- Major League Triathlon Series\n- The Military Triathlon Championship at Challenge Geraardsbergen\n- Race results from Xterra South Africa\n- The Zwift National Championships\n- And much more!\n\nIn last weeks poll, we asked you whether you put your shoes on in T1 or attach them to the bike. It was a close on this week with 55% of you clipping your shoes on to the bike. This time, we want to know how you feel about the new finish shoot rules.
