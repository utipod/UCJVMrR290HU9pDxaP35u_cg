description = "We're here in Kona, with Cyril Viennot's Scott Plasma Premium TT and his Triathlon race kit. First, start with the frame. It's pretty stealthy looking with it's matte black finish and it's got several aero features such as the deep tubing here at the head tube and the seat tube and then also around the bottom bracket here. And it's got other features such as the integrated front brake, just hidden in here, and then the back brake is hidden underneath the bottom bracket with an extra cover for added aero and also it's got the dropped seat stays. \n\nMoving forward, he's using the profile design, base bar, and poles. He's also got the profile design integrated hydration system and then for changing gears, he's using the SRAM eTap and he's got blips on his base bars and at the end of his poles. \n\nCyril's using the Zipp 404 wheel on the front and he's got the Zipp 808 on the back. And on those, he's using the Continental Grand Prix 4000, 23 mil clincher tyres. \n\nHe's using the SRAM Red eTap front and rear derailers, he's got the 55/42 chainrings, and an 11/25 cassette. He's using the Quarq power metre, he's got the SRAM Red cranks at 175 mil, and on the end of those he's using the Time Carbon Xpresso pedals. \n\nOn top of his Scott Plasma seat tube, he's using the Sitero Time Travel saddle. Moving on to the finishing touches, he's using a profile design bottle cage behind his saddle, he's also got the elite Crono CX cage and bottle on the dam tube here, and then just beneath that he's got the specifically made Drag 2 Zero storage compartment, which is made just for this bike, and that's where he keeps his punch and repair kit. And then on his top tube, he's got this profile design bento box, where he keeps all his nutrition. \n\nMoving on to Cyril's race kit, he's gonna be using the Kiwami swim skin and then underneath that for the bike and the run, he's got the Kiwami Trisuit and he's also using the Scott Split Time Trial helmet. He's using personalised Scott Fusion Lamenate Tri-shoes, he's running in the Hoka Tracers, he's got the Polar V800 watch, and finally he's got the BV Sport Elite compression socks. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/4D\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/4E\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Climb On A TT Bike - http://gtn.io/climbtribike\nüìπ  Kyle Buckingham's Pro Bike - http://gtn.io/KBLookprobike\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
