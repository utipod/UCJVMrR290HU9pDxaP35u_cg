title = "Mark Threlfall's Presenter Pro Bike With SRAM Aero HRD Disc Brakes"
description = "I've just finished a ride, and I thought I'd take the opportunity to run you through the bike that I've been using for the last few months, along with a few set-up choices and a couple of new additions to the bike. \n\nThis is the Cervelo P5X, commonly referred to as a superbike due to its wacky frame design where it's pushing the boundaries in terms of its aerodynamics. But with that it does mean it's not legal for UCI racing, but it is legal for a lot of triathlon races, which is lucky for us triathletes. I've had the opportunity to ride this, and I have to say I was sceptical in the start, but over the last few months of riding it, it has become my go-to bike. \n\nNow something I'm really excited to talk about are my brakes. And until now I've been riding the part-mechanical, part-hydraulic disc brakes, but now I have the new SRAM S-900 Aero HRD disc brakes that are fully hydraulic and a lot easier to actuate, for what appears to be a more powerful braking. And whilst I haven't needed to, the levers can actually be adjusted to a different distance for different hand sizes. And another nice touch is the textured underneath of the lever for added grip when your hands are wet or sweaty during training or racing. And moving down through the brake, the callipers are mounted using a flat-mount, and then the discs are 160 mil for maximum braking. \n\nThis bike is fully kitted out with SRAM RED eTap on both the front and rear derailleurs, which is fully wireless, meaning they can be controlled by the individual buttons on the end of the aero bars. To make things even better they have what's called Blips, which means when I'm on a training ride or during a technical part of a race and I'm not in the aero bars, I can change gear easily without having to reach forward each time. Now with this fully-wireless function, it does mean that each component has to have its own battery, but these can be easily removed and charged. \n\nOn my crankset I am riding a 55/42 chainring setup, and you'll probably notice within that I have a Quarq power metre, and it is the Quarq DZero power metre, which records both right and left leg power for more accurate power data. And on that crankset I am running the SRAM RED cranks at 172.5 length, and then on the end of those I have the Look Keo 2 Max pedals, and also on the back I'm running an 11-28 SRAM cassette. \n\nOn to the wheels. I'm running the Zipp 808 Firecrest wheels on both the front and the rear, and on those I'm running the Continental Grand Prix 4000 tyres, but come race day I would switch these over to a TT-specific race tyre. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/4o\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/4p\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCafe Mornings - Andreas Jamsheree\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Susie Cheetham's Cervelo P5X - http://gtn.io/SCheethamP5X\nüìπ  TT vs Road Bike Descending - http://gtn.io/TTvsRdDescending\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
