title = "How To Ride Into A Headwind | Should You Increase Your Power?"
description = "Headwinds make cycling hard and slow you down. But what is the best way to ride in them? How should your power, position and cadence change when you ride into a headwind.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/fo \n\nIn association with Quarq.\n\nFor many of us triathletes, we‚Äôll turn up to a race with a target pace or power in mind. And that‚Äôs all very well for a perfectly flat course with zero wind, but, unless you‚Äôre cycling around a velodrome then it‚Äôs unlikely these will be the conditions for your race.\n\nOne of the big factors we need to consider with our pacing is the wind. Should you ride harder into a headwind? Should you ease off? Should you get more aero? Should you increase your cadence? \n\nWell, we‚Äôre in the perfect location to discuss this! We‚Äôre in Kona for the Ironman World Championships with its infamously windy course. We‚Äôre going to be analysing our power, thanks to our partners Quarq and we‚Äôre going to be talking you through how to get the most out of those pesky headwinds.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/fn \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ 4 Exercises To Increase Your Power On The Bike | Strength Workout For Triathletes - http://gtn.io/4IncreasePower\nüìπ How To Improve Your Triathlon Training | What Is FTP? - http://gtn.io/FTP\n \nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nSunday - Ballpoint.mp3\nWonder - Cushy.mp3\nAutomate - [ocean jams].mp3\nTurquoise Waves - Sarah, the Illstrumentalist.mp3\nPullen Park - Sarah, the Illstrumentalist.mp3\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
