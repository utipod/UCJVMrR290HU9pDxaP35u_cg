title = "How To Increase Your Power On The Bike | 3 Bike Workouts To Make You Faster"
description = "It's the beginning of a new season so you've probably already started to look at your diary and plan those goals for the upcoming months. And now, as athletes, we naturally aspire to improve and get faster and faster year on year, but how exactly can we get faster? Yes, finding more power is one sure way of shaving seconds, if not minutes, off your overall race time.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5u\n\nThanks to Club La Santa for the locations used in this shoot.\n\nSo you've probably heard the terms power and watt bandied about, but what exactly is a watt? Well, it's a unit used to measure your power and power is the rate at which you put force down to your pedals.\n\nWell, enough of the science, how can we actually find more watts?\n There's a common misconception that to increase your power you need to get stronger, but that's not the only way you can improve your power.\n\nYeah, so power is just the amount of force that is going through your pedals, but also, to improve power, you can up your cadence. So, how many revolutions per minute that your pedals turn over. So, if you increase your cadence and hold the same force, you'll actually increase your power.\n\nUpping your cadence is basically just a quick fix to improve your power, but if you want to improve your power in the long run, I'm afraid it does mean some hard work. And we've put together a couple of sessions that will help you improve on your own power.\n\nSo a great first session is the 40/20 drill. So that's basically 40 seconds pretty hard at about 120% of your FTP, and then you have 20 seconds real easy steady riding. And then, maybe, do that for five to 10 minutes if it's your first time trying it. And if you do feel okay after that, maybe do another set after it.\n\nWell, we've got another session that's at a higher level of intensity, and this basically involves riding at your 100% maximum, so you don't need any FTP, you just ride hard as you can for 60 seconds and then five minutes easy. And that sounds like a lot of rest, but if you've done it properly, you'll need all of those five minutes and then repeat that six times through.\n\nSo another great way to improve power is a bit of over gearing work. So find yourself a nice, constant gradient, a little bit of an uphill drag, drop it down a few gears and really slow that cadence down. You want to hold this for about five minutes.\n\nYou want to be roughly 50-60 RPMs so that's one pedal every second. And the idea is, if you know your FTP, to be at about 90% of that. Or, if you're not sure of that, you should struggle to talk a bit like me when you're going up the hill. When you reach the top, ride easy back to the bottom. Repeat this four to six times.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/5v\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nBeat Them Up 1 - Jan Chmelar (1)\nBeat Them Up 2 - Jan Chmelar (1)\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ What Is FTP And How To Calculate It? - http://gtn.io/FTP\nüìπ How To Train With Power - http://gtn.io/trainwithpower\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
