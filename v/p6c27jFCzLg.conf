description = "Whether in a triathlon or a running race, you can't always avoid the hills. All triathletes should learn how to adapt to running uphill and here are Mark's top tips to help!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/1f\n\nMany runners and triathletes avoid running uphill. However, come race day this isn't an option! Training on the hills helps building your strength and confidence as well as building your speed on the flat.\n\nHere are Mark's top tips for making running uphill feel easier and make you faster:\n\n- Posture - Stand tall and lean in to the hill. However, make sure to do this from the ankles and not from hips.\n\n- Short steps - Shorten your stride and keep a quick foot contact. This will help keep you tall and pace you effort. \n\n- Use your arms - Drive your arms straight forwards and backwards like pistons. Driving arms will help get over obstacles when running off road. Aim to keep them at 90 degrees angle and drive forward rather than across.\n\n-Pacing - Focus on effort rather than pace to prevent going in to the red and burning out early on a climb.\n\nGood luck and the more you run uphill the better it will feel!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/1g\n\nMusic:\nBF - BREAKS WARRIORS\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Train Anywhere With GTN's 40 Minute Lamp Post Intervals - http://gtn.io/RunInterval \nüìπ  5 Steps To The Ultimate TT Setup - http://gtn.io/TTsetup\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
