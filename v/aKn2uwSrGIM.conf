title = "Basic Baking: The Best Flapjack Recipe! | The Perfect Race Snack?"
description = "We all know that carbs are our friend when it comes to fueling for endurance sports. We donâ€™t need to complicate our nutrition plan, we just need to make sure weâ€™ve got something that we want to eat on those long rides and steady runs. In the line of keeping it simple both for stomach and cooking skills, Heather is here to share a delicious oat flapjack recipe. Recipe below ðŸ‘‡\n\nUseful Links\nSubmit your Photo and Video to us ðŸ‘‰ https://upload.gtn.com/\nCheck out the GTN Shop ðŸ‘‰ https://gtn.io/TeamKit\n\nINGREDIENTS\n250g oats\n2-3 TBSP golden syrup\n125g butter\n125g brown sugar\n\nBefore we start the melting and mixing youâ€™ll need to find yourself a baking tray, 20cm x 20cm approx and some sort of baking paper or foil to line it with. Then turn your oven to 180deg C / 350 F.\n\nOnce youâ€™ve lined your tin with the paper youâ€™ve chosen, smother that in butter, youâ€™ll find it easier if your butter is at room temperature. Make sure youâ€™re generous, we donâ€™t want the flapjacks sticking. \n\nIf you havenâ€™t yet done so, weigh out all of the ingredients. \nNow onto the fun part, the melting. You could do this in a microwave but thereâ€™s something far more satisfying about stirring it over the stove. Add the butter, sugar and syrup into your saucepan and on a low heat stir occasionally until the butter has melted and the sugar granules are no longer noticeable. \n\nNote you can swap up the sugar, I sometimes use coconut sugar for a subtle flavour change and even substitute honey in for the golden syrup. Do be careful though as honey is usually a little runnier so can affect the consistency. \n\nIf you want diary free flapjacks then look at swapping the butter with a vegan butter or even try coconut oil if you like that flavour. \n\nThe beauty of these flapjacks is their simplicity. You can add to this ingredients with nuts, fruit, desiccated coconut, chocolate chips, the choice is huge. All of those Iâ€™ve mentioned need to be mixed in with the oats, unless youâ€™re using huge amounts they shouldnâ€™t change the consistency.\n\nPour the goey mixture over the oats in the bowl but Iâ€™m always keen to reduce the washing up so I pour the oats into the saucepan instead. Mix until theyâ€™re all fully coated and then spoon into your prepared tray. \n\nLevel out the ingredients using the back of the spoon.\nPop in the oven and check after 10â€™. Youâ€™re looking for the flapjacks to look golden brown. Too pale and they wonâ€™t be cooked and will be too goey, too dark and theyâ€™ll start to caramelise and become too crunchy.\n\nWhen out of the oven turn out and cut into squares. Theyâ€™ll still be warm so place on a cooling rack to fully cool before placing into an airtight container. \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nðŸ“¹  Watch our Editorâ€™s Choice Playlist ðŸ‘‰  https://gtn.io/editorschoice \nðŸ“¹  Watch our weekly show, The GTN Show ðŸ‘‰  https://gtn.io/GTNshowPlaylist \n\nPhotos: Â© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nðŸŽµ Music - licensed by Epidemic Sound / Artlist ðŸŽµ [DELETE AS APPRORPRIATE]\n\n#gtn #triathlon #swimbikerun #swim #bike #run  [Insert appropriate Hashtags here]\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
