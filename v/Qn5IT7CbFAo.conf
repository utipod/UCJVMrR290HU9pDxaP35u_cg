title = "Better With Age? | The GTN Show Ep. 46"
description = "We thought we’d make the most of the sun here in the UK so we’ve taken the GTN Show outside! This week we discuss whether triathletes can get better with age, we’ve got some new tech from Zwift, a nasty training crash and some graphene running shoes. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/bj\n\nBetter with age? We discuss whether it’s possible that triathletes can get better as they get older. They may grow in experience but does this make them a better athlete? We’ve also got an interesting acquisition from Zwift who are moving into the running power meter market.  We discuss the nasty training incident of professional triathlete Jan Frodeno, who crashed at 60kmph, get well soon Jan! We’ve also got all your favourite regular segments and we announce the winner from last weeks caption competition, cracking entries as ever. 👍\n\nDo you think triathletes can get better with age?
