If you‚Äôre after an easy session, this is not for you. This is a real time-efficient, bang for your buck session - focussing on top-end power - useful for all distances of triathlon.\n\nMark is performing this session indoors using a turbo trainer, and a treadmill. However, this can be performed outside, or a mix of both. Quite often I will cycle indoors and then run off the bike outdoors.\n\nIf you‚Äôre new to brick sessions, the idea is that we run off the bike, as we would within a triathlon or duathlon. That means having your running trainers ready, and perhaps a change of kit. We‚Äôre after a slick transition here.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/w2\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Why Is Indoor Cycling So Hard? | Triathlon Training Explained üëâ https://gtn.io/TTEIndoorCycling\nüìπ Improve Your Running Speed | 3 Workouts To Make You Run Faster! üëâ https://gtn.io/RunFasterWorkouts\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nSuper 1 STEMS INSTRUMENTS - Cospe\nSuper 1 STEMS DRUMS - Cospe\nTerrain - Splasher!\nMonkey Mind - Veevel\nHello My Friend - Lovren\nSick And Tired (Instrumental Version) - Mad Modishi\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal-winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nFelt bicycles: https://gtn.io/Felt\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
