description = "On this week's GTN Show, we discuss whether triathletes are the toughest competitors, or whether they are just plain crazy?!

We've seen many top level triathletes, including Susie Cheetham and Chrissie Wellington, finishing and even winning races after seriously bad crashes! With some of the toughest coaches such as Brett Sutton out there, what do you think? Can you name a tougher group of athletes?\n\nIn last weeks poll, we asked you what face you make when you race? The most popular option, with 43% of your votes was looking natural... we think you're not trying hard enough! This week, we ask you what is the worst thing about triathlon?\n\nAlso on the show this week, we discuss:\n- Race results from Ironman 70.3 Dubai, with a special interview brought to you by Mark Buckingham.\n- Mark qualifying for the Otillo SwimRun World Champs with Richard Stannard.\n- Para-triathlete Keiichi Sato competing at the Winter Olympics.\n- Javier Gomez racing Challenge Wanaka.\n- Sebastian Kienle and Ben Hoffman racing Cape Epic.\n\nAs well as the latest in all things triathlon, we have our usual segments such as the #GTNPainCave, #GTNTRIBE and CAPtion competition.\n\nWe hope you enjoy episode 26 of the GTN Show, let us know what you think is the worst thing about triathlon in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/6V\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  5 Pro Training Hacks & Do They Work - http://gtn.io/TrainingHacks\nüìπ Gear Ratios Explained For A Triathlon - http://gtn.io/GearRatio\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
