description = "You are entering the final big block of training for your first triathlon! It's time to be as prepared as possible for the event - test your kit, practice running off the bike and try out your transitions.\n\nIn part 4 of our ‚ÄòHow To Train For Your First Triathlon‚Äô series, we cover weeks 7-10 of your training plan.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/8q\n\nSwimming - \nAs you near the event, the aim is to comfortably increase the length of your swimming reps. The ultimate aim being that by week 10, you are able to cover the full distance of the triathlon swim in one go. It‚Äôs also time to start thinking about open water swimming. Keeping to your two swims per week, you can simply replace one of those with an open water swim. This is also a perfect opportunity to try out any of your equipment such as a tri-suit or wetsuit.\n\nCycling - \nOn the bike, you want to start dialling into a pace that you know you can sustain for the triathlon. It‚Äôs very easy to get carried away on the day due to adrenaline so practicing race pace during your training rides will get you used to the effort level. You should maintain two rides per week, with the aim to start covering the distance of your triathlon on one of these rides. If you haven‚Äôt done so already, this is also a good time to do a recce/recon of the bike course.\n\nRunning - \nAgain, you want to build up to covering the distance required for your triathlon and you should aim to do this at least once before the event. One 45-60 minute run, then a 20-30minute run off the bike is a good target later in your training plan. As with the bike, it's worth dialling in your desired running pace for the triathlon.\n\nAnd finally, as ever, make sure you enjoy yourself üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/8p\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Choose Your First Triathlon Event - http://gtn.io/ChooseYourFirstTriathlon\nüìπ How To Train For Your First Triathlon - http://gtn.io/TrainForFirstTri\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nBuzzin' With The Fuzz - Henrik Andersson\nLeave This World Behind (Instrumental Version) - Sebastian Forslund\nSatellite - Onda Norte (1)\nTurn Up The Love STEMS DRUMS\nWHAT - Aldous Young\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
