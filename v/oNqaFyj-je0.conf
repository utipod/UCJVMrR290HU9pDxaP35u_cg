description = "We were lucky enough to catch up with Lionel Sanders about his crazy indoor training regime. Sanders has become renowned for this and we get an insight into how he goes about it!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/aC \n\nSanders trains mostly indoors due to having been involved in multiple accidents with cars and for the increased training benefit. Indoor training is known to produce great results and no one knows this more than Lionel Sanders! He conducts the majority of his training indoors either on the turbo trainer or a treadmill. Some of the sessions he does sound seriously hard! Sanders has even got the stage where he prefers to train inside than venturing out.\n\nDo you like to train indoors?
