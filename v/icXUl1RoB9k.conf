title = "How Can You Deal With Race Day Nerves? | Ask GTN With Holly Lawrence"
description = "We're hear in Chattanooga at the 70.3 Ironman World Championships, just a couple of days before the race, and the reigning world champion, Holly Lawrence, has said that she'd like to have a chat with us. So, we're just outside her hotel. We're gonna go and find her and ask her a few questions.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5M\n\nThanks, Holly, for joining us. Well, obviously we were chatting earlier, and you were saying about your injury a few months ago. I know as an athlete, it's that constant balance, of how you're pushing yourself hard enough, but staying injury-free. How do you find that balance? How do you work that out?\n\nYeah, well last year it was all about being consistent. The year before, I had kind of up and down results, because of just putting together a really couple of hard weeks, and then being floored by it. This year, I had a really consistent winter, and my last year results showed after a consistent year. I actually got an injury which was unrelated to an overuse or anything, as most kind of injuries are of pushing yourself or whatever, where I kind of pinged it on a rock coming out of an ocean swim. So, it was just one of those unfortunate things, and I'm lucky that it's kind of healed up now. Yeah, I'd lost a bit of running, but we'll see.\n\nBut how do you, so you know, you've, I don't think lucky's the right word, but with that, how do you manage how much you can push your body, and what do you listen to to cut it back?\n\nYeah, well I'm very in tune with just how I feel, and I think I've been doing it enough now that, to just trust what I think and what my body tells me ultimately. I'm lucky that the coaches that I work with are very science-based, so usually the numbers back up how I feel anyways, so it's not like we're contradicting each other.\n\nWhat do you measure, then? What numbers do they take?\n\nSo, it's all like stress scores, because of the power data and heart rate data and everything that comes out of my training, mainly on the bike because it's the biggest kind of commitment. Train Sharp, my cycling coaching company, they track all of that, and they can see if my stress level, like the total stress balance is elevated, that you know it's only gonna be a matter time that I'm gonna be ill or injured or whatever. So, that's taken away a lot of the guesswork behind that.\n\nDo you find when they tell you that, that you normally are like, "Oh, yeah." It adds up with how you're feeling? Or does sometimes it surprises you, and you're like, "No, I'm fine."\n\nYeah and no. Pretty much, the data always reflects how I feel. Like if I'm feeling really tired or whatever, you can look back on the last how many weeks, and it's like, "Yeah, it's okay, I'm supposed to be tired. "It's because of this, and I need a bit more rest," or whatever it is, yeah.\n\nThat's cool. I saw you changed that recently with that. Was it a few years ago then, when you go to working more with numbers?\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/5N\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Run Like A Pro - http://gtn.io/RunPro\nüìπ  Ask GTN With Chrissie Wellington - http://gtn.io/AskChrissie\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
