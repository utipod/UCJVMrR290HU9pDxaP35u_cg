We explored a number of products that claimed to give us an aerodynamic advantage but compared that saving with their cost - giving a cost per watt figure.\n\nWe‚Äôre going to look at a bunch of products. All of which claim to save a certain number of watts. But we‚Äôre also going to compare them alongside their price, therefore allowing us to see how much each of those watts is costing us.\n\nOf course, there are so many factors at play when we compare products, so this isn‚Äôt an exact science, but Simon has spent more time testing cycling aerodynamics than most in the world. With over 15 years of experience. So it‚Äôs fair to say that he has a pretty good idea!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ   Cycling Costs Per Watt 1 üëâ  https://gtn.io/CostPerWatt\nüìπ  Time Trial Bike vs Road Bike üëâ  https://gtn.io/WindTunnelTest \n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nES_Can't Chill - Dylan Sitts\nES_Cut Corners - Dusty Decks\nES_Fallin' Thru Time - Guustavv\nES_Ice Cold Beverage - Dylan Sitts\nES_Mint Conditions - Dusty Decks\nES_Overthinking - Dylan Sitts\nES_Pomegranate - Jobii\nES_Spindle - Dusty Decks\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
