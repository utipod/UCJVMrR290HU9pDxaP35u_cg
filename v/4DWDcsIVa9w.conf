description = "The 2018 Ironman World Champs are set to be as competitive as ever with stacked fields in both the men's and women's events. We discuss the course, the athletes and who will be victorious.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/eu\n\nThe Course\n\nThe swim start in Hawaii has to be the most visually impressive of anything you will see anywhere in the sporting world, let alone just the Ironman circuit. It‚Äôs a non-wetsuit swim, so it can play into the hands of those naturally stronger swimmers as the athletes complete a one loop course.\n\nThe bike course at Kona is often described as being brutal! Whilst there is a climb to Hawi at the turnaround, this only accounts for little over 500ft. It‚Äôs the heat, the humidity and the wind that really make this course so tough! \n\nBut it‚Äôs the run that tends to eat athletes up, and spit them out. Burning too much too soon in the run can be costly. After exiting T2, runners will wind their way through town and onto Ali‚Äôi Drive, where spectators pack the roads to cheer the athletes on. They will then retrace their steps before climbing up Palani Road to the Queen K Highway to make their way to the infamous and unforgiving Natural Energy Lab. This year the course has been adapted to spend a fraction more time in the Energy Lab before coming back down the Queen K and towards the finish.\n\nThe Athletes\n\nYou'll have to watch the video to find out who we think will come out on top!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/et \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Ironman Triathlon World Championships Course Preview | How Tough Is Kona? - http://gtn.io/KonaCoursePreview17\nüìπ Top Triathletes Never To Win The Ironman World Championship In Kona - http://gtn.io/NotWinKona\n \nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nJust My Luck - Matt Large\nKing Masa - Axel Ljung\nOnce Upon A Time In Detroit 1 (Remix Version) - Axel Ljung\nThe Days Of Old - Matt Large\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
