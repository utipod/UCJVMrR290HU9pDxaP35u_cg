title = "Zone 3 Triathlon Training: Should You Train in Zone 3?"
description = "Zone 3, The Grey Zone, The Zone 3 Plateau - we're often told that training in this middle ground is a bad idea! But, in this video, we tell you why it's not all bad and how you can use this training zone to your advantage!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/j8 \n\nZone 3 is often described as a ‚Äúcomfortably hard‚Äù effort, or as the fastest speed that still feels relaxed. It‚Äôs the kind of intensity that you could continue to chat to someone, but you‚Äôre going to be struggling to have a full-blown conversation. It‚Äôs somewhere around 6-7 on the RPE scale.\n\nThere isn‚Äôt actually anything wrong with training in zone 3, so long as it is beneficial for the type of racing you‚Äôre doing. If you are racing in events that are longer than about 2 or 3 hours, then it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôre going to hitting Zone 3 for some extended periods of time. In this video, we discuss the benefits of training in the 'grey zone' and give you some examples workouts for swim, bike & run.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/j7 \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Fitness Testing - https://gtn.io/FitnessTests\nüìπ Triathlon Training Explained | What Is Critical Swim Speed? -  https://gtn.io/TTECritcalSwim\n\nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nBlue Hills - Yellowbase\nGanja - Ooyy\nGhost Moan - SFX Producer\nPool Chalk Cue 2 - SFX Producer\nGhost Pass By 6 - SFX Producer\nSick Days - Dylan Sitts\nTrouble By Trouble (Luwaks Remix)(Instrumental Version) - The Eastern Plain\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
