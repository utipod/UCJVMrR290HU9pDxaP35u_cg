description = "Without an effective kick, your freestyle stroke will fall apart. It‚Äôs crucial not only for the propulsion, but also for the balance and rotation within the water. So, here are Mark's 4 ways to improve your front crawl kick.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/d7\n\nAs triathletes, we‚Äôre looking to save our legs for the bike and run sections of the race. So, we‚Äôre not necessarily looking for a crazy fast kick, but we are looking to get an effective kick for minimum effort. And most importantly, we don‚Äôt want our kick to be slowing us down!\n\nThe kick should come from the hips with a soft flex through the knee. Make sure you‚Äôre not just kicking from the knees and keeping your thighs still. The kick should also follow right through to your toes, meaning a good flexion from the ankles to finish the kick. Remembering this and practising the drills in this video you will improve your kick in no time.\n\n4 ways to improve your front crawl kick include:\n- Kicking with a board\n- Improving ankle flexibility\n- Vertical kicking\n- Kicking on your side\n\nMark goes into detail on all of these during the video. Which do you think would make the biggest difference to your front crawl kick?\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/d8\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Top 5 Essential Swim Skills To Master | Triathlon Swimming Tips For Beginners - http://gtn.io/SwimSkills\nüìπ 4 Swim Workouts For Triathletes ‚Äì Intermediate Level - http://gtn.io/SwimWorkouts\n\nMusic: \nStays The Same (Instrumental Version) - Gloria Tells\nThrough The Static - Keppel Skies\nWhat's In It For Me (Instrumental Version) - Gloria Tells\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
