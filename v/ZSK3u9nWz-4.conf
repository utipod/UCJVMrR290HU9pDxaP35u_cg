title = "10 Tips For Young Triathletes | Improve Your Triathlon Training And Skills"
description = "The growth of triathlon has lead to increased participation across all age groups, with shorter distance events catering to youths and juniors. But just how should young triathletes train to prepare for these events?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/bC\n\nGetting into triathlon doesn't mean that you require all of the latest and greatest kit, or training for hours on end. In fact it can be easy to overwork yourself at a young age and damage your body whilst it is still growing. Instead your time could be better spent practising transitions and honing your technique, as these skills will make all the difference on race day. \nIt can also be difficult to balance training with education, so it's important to be flexible and able to prioritise. Recovery and recuperation are equally as important, so make sure that you eat well and get plenty of sleep.\nBut most importantly, remember to have fun and enjoy it. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/bD\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Training for your first Triathlon | http://gtn.io/1sttriathlonplaylist\nüìπ Balance Work and Training | http://gtn.io/AskGTNPH\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nJust You And Me (Instrumental Version) - Sebastian Forslund\nYoung And Free 3 - Victor Olsson\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
