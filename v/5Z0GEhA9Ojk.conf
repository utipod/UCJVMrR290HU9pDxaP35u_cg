title = "Indoor Cycling Kit Choice | What To Wear On The Turbo Trainer"
description = "Indoor training is often unavoidable when the weather is less than desirable outside and you want to some high quality cycling training. But what should you wear for an turbo workout?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/9F\n\nIf you like the kit Mark and Heather are wearing in this video, check it out here:\n- ASSOS Men's 1.4 Summer range: http://gtn.io/AssosSummerM\n- ASSOS Women's 1.4 Summer range: http://gtn.io/AssosSummerW\n\nIn association with ASSOS.\n\nLove it or hate it, indoor training is unavoidable for many of us! Especially if we want to maintain our training when the weather is less than desirable outside. Some triathletes even swear by it - you can get your head down and get some good quality cycling in. \n\nBut what should you wear for an indoor workout?! It's not as simple as you may think! A lot of our normal cycling clothing is designed for cycling outdoors and often keeping you warm. Wearing the same gear indoors can result in overheating, and hamper the quality of your session. \n\nEven with a great fan setup, that alone is going to struggle to fully replicate the outdoors in terms of removing your sweat and keeping your body at an optimum temperature to perform. This is where it is important to look to clothing that will wick the sweat away from your skin, and allow your body to cool. This may sound counterintuitive, particularly if you‚Äôre used to wearing nothing on your top, but we are in fact suggesting you opt for a layer to help cool yourself more.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video and found it helpful, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/9G\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Choose An Indoor Trainer - http://gtn.io/ChooseATrainer\nüìπ Strength Training With GTN | Indoor Hill Training - http://gtn.io/IndoorStrengthWorkout\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nWah whats up 3 - Anders Bothen\nMy last song (tigerblood jewel remix instrumental)\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
