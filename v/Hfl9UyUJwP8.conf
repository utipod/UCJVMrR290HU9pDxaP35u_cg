description = "Kask‚Äôs latest aerodynamic road helmet, the Utopia, has two special limited edition designs to celebrate the Ironman world championships in Kona. And you could win one!\n\nIn association with Kask.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/eW\n\nEnter the promotion here:\nhttp://gtn.io/unboxutopia\n\nThat‚Äôs right we‚Äôre giving away three Kask Utopia aero road helmets in the special Kona limited edition design. \n\nThe Utopia is Kask‚Äôs latest entry into the aero road helmet market, released earlier this year at the Tour Down Under, and worn exclusively by Team Sky in the Tour de France. Bridging the gap between a dedicated time trial helmet and a regular vented helmet, the Kask Utopia is a capable all rounder. Faster than their previous road helmets in wind tunnel testing, the Kask Utopia also has the advantage of being better ventilated than a dedicated aerodynamic helmet which is an attractive and adaptable prospect for triathletes.\nDeveloped using Kask‚Äôs proprietary computational fluid dynamic testing against 10 of the best aero helmets available, the Utopia was designed to perform at different speeds and varying wind yaw angles. This means that it is equally effective in cross winds as it is in conventional time trial simulations, where it will save a claimed 6 watts when riding at 50 kph. \n\nInternally the Utopia has some ingenious Resistex padding, which uses fast wicking fabric to draw moisture away from your head, whilst also providing a comfortable fit. The helmet also uses Kask‚Äôs popular Octo Fit adjustment system to hold the helmet secure in place. \n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/eV\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Custom Kona Tech | http://gtn.io/CustomTech\nüìπ Kona by numbers | http://gtn.io/KonaInNumbers\n\nüéµ Epidemic Sound:\nMarkers - Homebody\nOdyssey - [ocean jams]\nOnce Upon A Time In Detroit 2 - Axel Ljung\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
