title = "How To Use A Foam Roller | Strength And Conditioning For Triathletes"
description = "Using a foam roller is a cheap and easy way to do self-massage. Keeping your legs fresh and ready for your next training session. And the best part about it, you can take it with you anywhere you go. But, if you are worried that you haven't quite got room in your bag to fit this, then you could also use something like a spiky ball, or similar. And it will do the same job. \n\nBut before we get started, just a little warning. If you do these exercises properly, they can be a bit uncomfortable on the foam roller. But on the plus side, you will get a benefit in the long term. \n\nWe're gonna work from the bottom to the top. So that means we're gonna start with our calf muscles. And you probably notice I've swapped for a different foam roller. Now this one is slightly softer and more forgiving. And that's 'cause for me, my calves are quite tight and quite sensitive. So, go with what you need. And from this position, take the weights into you hands, so you can lift up. And then you can roll just nice and slowly. Your calf muscles moving over the top of the foam roller. And you want to try and get the full length of the muscle right up 'til just beneath your knees. And then very gradually, roll back again. And then, if you find this isn't quite enough pressure, you can always put one leg on top of the other, and then you're just working the muscle of the bottom leg. And then roll over that way. But for me, my calves are so tight, that's actually a little bit too much. So I'm just gonna stick with doing both legs at once. \n\nMoving on up the body, and staying in a supine position. So on your back. We're gonna go to hamstrings next. So basically, from just above your knee, up to your bottom. And this time, I'm opting to do one leg at a time. So it's not quite as much pressure. I'm gonna start just behind my knee. And then take the weight onto the foam roller. Rolling all the way up. And then slowly back down. Now again, if you wanted to add the pressure, you could do, as I showed you in the past, I put one leg on top of the other. Or, you could do it with both legs at once if you've got a wider foam roller. \n\nBut now it's time to move on to your front, into the prone position. 'Cause we're going to working on your quadricep muscles. Basically the front of your thighs. So from just above your knee, into your hip. And I personally find this exercise easier to do with both legs at once. It's just a slightly easier position to find. So, from here, you're just going to lie over the top of the foam roller. Again, taking the weight in your hands. And you're gonna roll your body from your hips, down to your knees. And then back again. Nice and gently.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/4F\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/4G\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nJONATAN JARPEHAG - BEAT ME 1\nANDRE AGUADO - CRISTAUX\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Deal With Being An Injured Triathlete - http://gtn.io/DealWithInjury\nüìπ  7 Resistance Band Exercises For Triathletes - http://gtn.io/7bandexercises\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
