title = "6 Winter Training Tips | Make The Most Of Your Winter Riding"
description = "Training in the winter is obviously different from in season, but not just the obvious reasons such as the weather. You've got limited daylight hours and just getting out on the bike some much more effort. But mixing up your training sessions in those winter months is a great way to get the base training in ready for the season.\n\nHaving flexible joints and muscles is great but that's not actually what I'm referring to here. It's about the flexibility with your training programme. So if you do have the chance to be able to move your rides and sessions around within the week, it's great and then hopefully, you can make the most of any nice weather when it comes. Yeah, I've just checked and tomorrow's lot is pretty grim so I recommend we get three hours done today. But seriously, if you get a nice day of weather in the winter, take the opportunity and get on your bike.\n\nYou can ride harder and shorter now in the colder, darker months, and then when the conditions start to improve, you can increase your mileage. The winter doesn't have to be about slogging out in the cold dark and wet, you can make your training more race specific in intensity now, and you'll still see a benefit when you get to race season. And when it gets really cold, it's as simple as just getting your head down, get on the drops, and ride harder. It'll make you have a small surface area, you'll stay warmer, and you can do some more of that sweet spot training. \n\nAnother great way to train in the winter is to use your surroundings. I like to ride up every hill hard. It's great to do it in a group, everyone's on the same page and you can regroup at the top. And it's great for getting power in the legs as well as keeping your training interesting. But if you don't have any hills, then maybe try it with a head wind. Every time you hit that head wind, just ride hard.\n\nWhen you're cold, finding a nice long steady uphill is pretty appealing. Not only do you get to warm up, it's also can be a little bit social. But on the flip side, what goes up, must come down. Yeah, last thing you wanna do is go down a long, cold, shivering decent. That's horrible. I'd pick a route that's mainly flat with some short, sharp hills.\n\nYou see a lot of pros using over and under gearing in their training recently and we spotted the world champ, Daniela Ryf, using overgearing as part of her prep for Kona. And this isn't just great for mixing up your training in the winter, but also helps with your power, and getting you a nice, smooth peddle stroke.\n\nYeah, so essentially all you need to do is drop it down a few sprockets, lower that cadence right down, try and keep your torso as rigid as possible. What I'm trying to do is ask my body to put more force through the peddles and for me, someone with weak glutes, and I really need to work on this by pushing down through the heel, and it really recruits those muscle groups. \n\nAnd then on the other end of the spectrum, you're got undergearing, where basically you just need to concentrate on trying to spin your legs fast, anything around and over 100 RPM.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/4L\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/4M\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  8 Essential Training Tips For Every Triathlete - http://gtn.io/8TrainingTips\nüìπ  How To Run Like A Pro - http://gtn.io/RunPro\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
