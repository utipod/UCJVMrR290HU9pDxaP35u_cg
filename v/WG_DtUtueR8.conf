description = "In association with TrainingPeaks - http://gtn.io/TrainingPeaks\n\nOn this week's Triathlon Training Explained Show we're at the Porsche Experience Center looking at perspiration testing and sweat composition. This specific testing allows athletes to plan optimal hydration for racing in different conditions.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/aT\n\nAt the Silverstone Human Performance Center, Mark and Heather are put through their paces in a 42-degree heat chamber! They each ran for 22 minutes in order to calculate their hourly sweat rates. Another test was conducted to analyse their sodium levels with Mark's levels being considerably higher than Heather's, meaning he may be more susceptible to cramping. The testing highlights the importance of personal hydration plans, with products working for some athletes that may not suit others.\n\nHave you had a scientific sweat test? üëá\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nFor more information on this topic, check out the following links from training peaks:\n- Does Peeing Clear Really Mean You're Hydrated? - http://gtn.io/TPPeeClear\n- How to Avoid These 3 Common Long Distance Racing Hydration Pitfalls - http://gtn.io/TPCommonHydrationFail\n- Does 'Drink to Thirst' Hydration Really Work for Endurance Athletes? - http://gtn.io/TPDrinkToThirst\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/aS\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Triathlon Training Explained Playlist http://gtn.io/TTEPlaylist\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nDrone Dark Mys 4 - SFX Producer\nDrone Musical 5 - SFX Producer\nFalling In Love (Instrumental Version) - Sebastian Forslund\nIndulgent - Uygar Duzgun\nLove For The Ocean (Tigerblood Jewel Remix) - Martin Hall\nPREL Glitch Static 4 - SFX Producer\nSex Drugs And Dr Martens 3 - Sven Karlsson\nYoung And Free 1 - Victor Olsson\nZootropio 3 - HaÃäkan Eriksson\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
