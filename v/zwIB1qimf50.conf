description = "The Commonwealth Games is one of the biggest events on the calendar of many professional triathletes. In 2018, we are heading over to the Gold Coast in Australia.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/8y\n\nThe first official Commonwealth Games were held in 1930 in Hamilton, Canada - when they were called the British Empire Games. \nFast forward to 2018, and the Games will be taking place on the Gold Coast, Australia between the 4th and 15th April. There will be more than 6,600 athletes and team officials from 70 nations, competing across 18 sports and 7 para-sports.\n\nFor the first time,  triathletes will compete over the fast and furious Sprint Distance with 750m swim, 20km bike and a 5km run - making it exciting to watch, but also allowing athletes to recover for the Mixed Team Relays 2 days later.\n\nThe mixed relays was first included at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, in Scotland. Teams comprise of 2 men, and 2 women -racing over a much shorter course, this year a 1-lap 250m swim, a 2-lap 7km bike, and a 1-lap 1.5km run. Typically these races last between an hour to ninety minutes depending on the course layout, with athletes each completing a mini-triathlon before tagging their teammate. \n\nIt was won in the 2014 Games by Team England, but what makes this event so exciting is that it takes far more than just one good athlete, and actually a team of lesser known athletes could collectively be very successful. \n\nIf you liked this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/8x\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Triathlon Training Jargon You Should Know - http://gtn.io/TriJargon\nüìπ The 7 Unwritten Rules Of Triathlon - http://gtn.io/7UnwrittenRules\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
