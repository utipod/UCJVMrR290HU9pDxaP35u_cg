title = "How To Fix A Bike Puncture On Race Day | Inner Tube Replacement Or Tyre Sealant?"
description = "Getting a puncture, especially on race day, can be very frustrating. Here is GTN's ultimate guide on how to fix a puncture on the roadside during a triathlon!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/2i\n\nGetting a puncture during a triathlon should not end your race. They can be quick to fix as long as you have the correct tools. There are two main ways to be back on the road quickly and Mark guides you through both of them in this video.\n\nThe first is replacing the inner tube and this requires a new inner tube, set of tyre levers and a mini pump (or CO2 cartridge). The key steps to this process are:\n- Remove the wheel from the bike\n- Check the tyre and remove the cause of the puncture\n- Deflate the tyre fully\n- Use the tyre levers to remove the tyre from one side of the rim\n- Remove the inner tube and check the inside of the tyre for sharp objects\n- Add some air to the inner tube and place into the tyre\n- Seat the tube and pull the tyre back over the rim being careful not to pinch the tube\n- Pump back up to the required pressure\n\nThe second option is a temporary but fast fix and that is using a tyre sealant. This will release a liquid latex along with a propane propellant into the tube. This will seal the point of puncture and inflate the tube up to 110 PSI. \n\nThese are both great ways to ensure you finish your next triathlon and aren't prevented from finishing by a puncture!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/2h\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ .
