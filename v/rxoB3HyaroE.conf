description = "This is Jonathan Brownlee's Scott Foil RC. We're currently at the ITU Grand Finale in Rotterdam where the conditions are less than favourable so forgive us for being inside. \n\nBut let's start with the frame. Now the Scott Foil RC is an Aeroframe. And interestingly, Johnny is on a size 54 frame which is a medium in Scot. Johnny is not far off my own height. I'm six foot one, ride a 56, so riding a 54, it's quite a small frame. But we might see some slight changes in his position and componentry. But we'll get to that later on. \n\nThe 454s are believed to perform really well in cross winds. And another interesting point is that these are actually tubular which are currently quite rare. And those are equipped with the Continental Competition Pro Limited tubular tyres. Which you'll quite often see a lot of the pros using. \n\nAnd with a groupset, he is running Sram Red eTap. Which is a wireless groupset with individual batteries in both the front and the rear mech. So his Sram Red crankset is a 172.5 crank length with Speedplay pedals. And he's got relatively standard gearing with 53-39 chainrings on the front. And he's using an 11-26 11 speed cassette which is also Sram Red. \n\nAnd moving back to the seatpost, he's got the standard Scott Foil seatpost with a sunken clamp for aerodynamic reasons. And then on top of the seatpost he has a Fizik Arione Saddle which has quite good cushioning. And it's also set back quite far. And as we've said he's on a 54 frame. So this just allows him to get into a nice aerodynamic position. \n\nThese have got a flat and aerodynamic profile to the top of the handlebars and then we've got the Sram eTap shifters and levers on the end. And to finish it off, he has Zipp Alumina Bottle Cages. And a little bit of tape to mark his position for whilst he's travelling.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3Q\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/3R\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCristaux - Andr√© Aguado\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  5 Bike Skills To Master - http://gtn.io/5BikeSkills\nüìπ  Alistair Brownlee's Scott Plasma Pro Bike - http://gtn.io/BrownleeBike\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
