Having recently switched from a 26" bike to this 29er, Carina finds that this mountain bike is better through the technical sections and easier to ride than a 26" bike. To help out on those technical downhills, Wasle added a dropper post at the start of the year.\n\nCarina chose a hardtail over a full suspension bike as most X-terra courses aren't *too* technically demanding, plus the hardtail saves a significant amount of weight, making climbing much, much easier. To help out even more with climbing, Wasle switched out the Shimano shifting on the bike for SRAM Eagle XX1, giving a huge bottom gear of 32x50.\n\nCheck out the full bike specs below, make sure you share this video and don't forget to comment if you ride X-Terrra!\n\nFrame: Specialized S-Works Fate 29er, size small (15.5")\nFront Suspension: Rockshox RS-1, 80mm\nWheelset: Roval Contol SL\nTyres: Specialized Fast Track 2.3; tyre pressure depending on the course, 1.8 bar (26psi) in the front 1.6 bar (23psi) in the rear\nBrakes: Shimano XTR\nRotors: 160mm\nHandlebars: Cut-down for narrow sections\nStem: 60mm\nShifters: SRAM Eagle XX1\nCrankset: SRAM, 165mm\nChainring: SRAM Eagle 32 tooth\nPedals: Shimano Deore XT\nCassette: SRAM Eagle, 10-50 tooth\nRear Mech: SRAM Eagle XX1\nSeatpost: LEV dropper seatpost\nSaddle: Specialized Myth saddle\n\nAnything Else: Sigma Rox 7.0\n\nWetsuit: Sailfish G-Range wetsuit, neutral buoyancy\nTri-suit: Zero-D\nHelmet: Specialized S3 \nShoes: Specialized Comp MTB shoes\nRunning shoes: Brooks Pure Connect.
