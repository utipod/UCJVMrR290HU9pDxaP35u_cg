title = "6 Ways To Plan A Training Route | How To Not Get Lost!"
description = "How can you train when you don't know where you're going? You could be in unfamiliar surroundings having just moved to a new area, you could have flown out early for a race and looking to explore the local roads, or you could just be going further afield to find new tracks in the hillsides. Whatever your purpose, it can be difficult to find new routes without a bit of local knowledge or the help of some purpose-built tech. Mark and James have a rundown of how to get started. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/UY\n\nYou don't just have to ask the locals anymore!
