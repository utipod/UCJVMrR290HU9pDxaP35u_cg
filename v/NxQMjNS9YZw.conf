title = "Triathlon Training When Travelling On Business Trips & Holiday  | How To Train In A Hotel"
description = "As triathletes, we love a routine and have a lot of training to fit in around our busy lives. This doesn't have to fall apart if you are staying in a hotel with limited facilities - there is always some training you can do!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/gb \n\nTravelling is part of work for many of us, and trying to balance your training in amongst that travel can be a really tough task (let alone trying to find places to actually do that training). \n\nWe‚Äôre sure many of you have experienced this before. You have a swim scheduled in your programme, but there is no swimming pool. Or a run, but you‚Äôre sandwiched between busy highways. It can seem like the end of the world at the time, but with a bit of planning and prior thought, you can prevent your training from really suffering. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/ga \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Train Indoors For Triathlon - The Treadmill, Turbo Trainer & Pool -  http://gtn.io/TrainIndoors\nüìπ Should You Workout When You're Sick? | The Effects Of Training When You're Ill - http://gtn.io/WorkoutIll\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nMother (Instrumental Version) - Staffan CarleÃÅn\nAlways Always (Tribute Version) (Explicit Version) - Martin Hall\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
