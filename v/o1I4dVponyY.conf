title = "8 Exercises To Fit Around Your Day | Strength And Conditioning For Triathlon"
description = "Strength and conditioning exercises can not only make you stronger, but also help keep you injury-free and therefore, make you a better athlete, so we've put together a few simple exercises you could fit around your day. \n\nThis exercise predominantly works your glute muscles and helps get them firing and functioning properly. Now, your glutes are needed for cycling and swimming, but they can be prone to switching off slightly and your hamstrings overcompensating for that weakness. Now, basically, all you need is some floor space, you can do it whilst watching the television, for example. Now, whilst lying on your back with your knees bent, you need to make sure you start by squeezing your glutes and then, just lift your hips up towards the ceiling, keeping your glutes firing the whole way through and then, lower down again gently. If you find that really easy and you're ready to progress, you can take it to doing it with one leg, make sure your hips stay level as you go up and then, lowering back down again. \n\nThis is a simple exercise and, as a result, can be done pretty much anywhere. So, you could multitask, maybe doing it whilst you're doing the washing up or on the train on your commute to work. To progress it slightly, you can maybe hold at the top to really get those calves firing and then, lower down really slowly or even move it up to one leg at a time and then, if you did want to increase the range of movement, maybe do it on the edge of a step so you can drop your heel down that much lower. \n\nThis is another exercise you can do in front of the TV and all you need is a bench or a chair with a firm edge and a little bit of space for your legs. Now, as the exercise says, it predominantly works you triceps, but also uses the rest of your shoulder muscles. Basically, all you need to do is lower your body down with your elbows pointing backwards. To make it easier, you can do it with your knees bent. If you want to make it harder, just move your feet slightly further away and have your knees straight. \n\nThis is an easy exercise to fit into your day. You can maybe do it whilst lying in bed in the morning, having a cup of tea, or just before you go to sleep. You need to be lying on your side with your hips parallel to the wall in front of you with your knees roughly to a 90 degree bend and then, keeping your feet touching, all you need to do is lift your knee up towards the ceiling, keeping your hips level, and then, lowering it back down. It's particularly good for activating glute mead, which sometimes can be prone to switching off or having an imbalance. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3r\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/3s\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nMile Soul - Da Tooby\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Ask GTN With Pieter Heemeryck - http://gtn.io/AskGTNPH\nüìπ  8 Essential Triathlon Training Tips - http://gtn.io/8TrainingTips\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
