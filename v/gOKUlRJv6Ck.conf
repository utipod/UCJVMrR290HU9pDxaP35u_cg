title = "Is 3D Printing The Future Of Triathlon? | Custom Tri Bike Kit"
description = "3D Printing is totally revolutionizing the cycling world & sport in general, so we thought we could pop along to meet the team at RaceWare Components to see what it‚Äôs all about! Oh, and Mark is going to be showing off his custom 3D Printed bike computer and camera mount!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/yc\n\nWith Mark competing at the Norseman Extreme Triathlon last summer, he decided he needed some way of attaching a GoPro to the front of his Canyon Speedmax, to capture everything we could! He could‚Äôve just attached the camera to the aero bars with a standard GoPro mount...but Mark loves his tech and likes his cockpit to looking clean. \n\nSo he thought, why not design a NEW bike computer mount - with a GoPro attachment underneath it?! This would require a custom design and build to specifically fit my bars and his setup! \n\nNow going back a number of years, this would cost a small fortune, if not just been totally infeasible. But with thanks to 3D Printing, we were able to contact Martyn from RaceWare Components and have Mark's idea brought to life within JUST a couple of days\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/yb\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ The Hottest Tech At Challenge Roth | GTN Expo Tour üëâ https://gtn.io/RothHotTech\nüìπ Custom Kona Triathlon Tech üëâ https://gtn.io/CustomKona\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nCar Talks - DJ DENZ The Rooster\nFuton - Osoku\nPillow Cases - Guustavv\nTiny Room Bop - [ocean jams]\nVisualize - [ocean jams]\nWishing For - Dylan Sitts\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal-winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nFelt bicycles: https://gtn.io/Felt\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
