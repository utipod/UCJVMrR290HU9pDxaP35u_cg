description = "GTN are going to be bringing you a series of videos to help you train and prepare for your first triathlon! You‚Äôve entered your first event...but where do you start? \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/66\n\nAs a minimum, we would recommend 12 weeks to realistically prepare for, and complete a triathlon. That‚Äôs not to say that it‚Äôs not possible in less time, but to turn up feeling relaxed and confident, then this length of preparation should do the trick. So, we‚Äôll be gearing our series of videos to a 10-12 week training time.\n\nAs triathletes, you have 3 sports to juggle and this can be quite challenging. If you work out six times in a week, you might swim twice, bike twice, and run twice, but your longest bike ride might be one hour, whereas your swims might last 30 minutes each and your runs, 40 minutes.\n\nIf you have a background in swimming, you can probably get away with doing a little less on your stronger discipline, and spend a little more time on your weaker disciplines. At least to bring them up to a point that you‚Äôre more comfortable with them. You can of course play to your strengths, but that‚Äôs for a later date, for now we want to make sure you complete your first triathlon comfortably.\n\nWhilst training for your first triathlon, it‚Äôs mostly about completion. So following a gradual and sensible plan that keeps you consistent with your training is the key.\n\nWe like to explain it as if you‚Äôre building the foundations. You can‚Äôt move on without those foundations, otherwise it will all fall apart. So, whilst it‚Äôs tempting, the harder and faster stuff could be more detrimental if you do it before you‚Äôre ready to.\n\nWe‚Äôve got three sports. That means three different sports to buy kit for. But, unless you really want to, there is no need to take out a mortgage for a new bike and other kit for your first triathlon. We‚Äôre sure you‚Äôll love the sport, but until you‚Äôve done an event it‚Äôs worth holding off on spending a load. \n\nIf you found this video useful, don't forget to give it a thumbs up and share with your friends!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/67\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nFlashing Lights - Daxten\nSmashing Punks 8 - Stefan Netsman\nSuffer City Blues (Instrumental Version) - Suffer City\nKeeping It Together 5 - Gunnar Johns√©n\nOnce I Was A Cat (Instrumental Version) - Suffer City (1)\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Choose Your First Triathlon - http://gtn.io/ChooseYourFirstTriathlon\nüìπ  Triathlon Mythbusters - http://gtn.io/TriMyths\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
