title = "How To Swim Backstroke | Technique For Back Crawl Swimming"
description = "Backstroke can be challenging to learn, it's the only stroke where you can't see where you're going and it requires good coordination and timing. With a bit of practice, however, you'll be swimming backstroke confidently in no time, and this video is a great place to start when learning the stroke!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/y2\n\nThe key to good backstroke starts with head positioning - maintaining a neutral head position looking upwards and not looking down. Following on from that, a good catch position and body rotation aid good propulsion in the water and a strong leg kick helps maintain good balance. It's hard to learn all of these things together so try picking one element and working on that till you have it mastered before moving on to the next skill.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/y3\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ https://gtn.io/xM\nüìπ https://gtn.io/FreestyleKickGuide\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nES_Riser Airy Crescendo - SFX Producer.mp3\nES_Cold Brew - Dylan Sitts.mp3\nES_Just Like Dat - Pro Reese.mp3\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal-winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nFelt bicycles: https://gtn.io/Felt\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
