description = "All triathletes can cycle faster, ride more efficiently and look smoother on the bike! Here are Mark and Heather's pro top tips to improve your triathlon bike leg üö¥\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/14\n\nAs well as being strong on the bike, pros also ride smoothly and efficiently. So, to be a pro, its not just about being able to put out a lot of power, its about getting the small things right too.\n\nHere are Mark and Heather's pro top tips for a faster bike leg:\n\nBike Position - \nBeing super aggressive isn't always faster, its about what is most comfortable for you and allows you to put out lots of power over a long period of time. Spend a lot of time in this race position to allow to be more comfortable on race day.\n\nTraining With Data -\nBeing able to monitor power during training and racing is a valuable tool for getting feedback on your effort. Its also good to know when to push harder and to back off. Heart Rate is also a valuable tool to help you ride at the right intensity and you can work out your zones by doing an FTP test.\n\nHalf Wheeling -\nThis is when one person rides half a wheel in front of another on a group ride. This is very frustrating for and can lose you a lot of cycling friends so don't do it!\n\nFuelling - \nNo pro's will fuel the same on race day as every athlete responds differently so make sure to find something that works for you. However, all pros will hydrate and fuel regularly throughout a race. Be smart about when and where you take this fuel onboard.\n\nFlying Mount/Dismount -\nThis may not be strictly cycling but is still very important for triathletes. This can really make the difference in a short distance event where every second counts. The mount is a skip and hop onto the saddle whilst the dismount takes a little pre planning and stepping over the saddle before hopping off.\n\nGood luck with these tips and let us know how you get on with them in the comment below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/13\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Run Like A Pro http://gtn.io/RunPro\nüìπ  GTN's Essential Triathlon Skills http://gtn.io/9TriSkills\n\nMusic: \nOver You_Einar Erlander\nWelcome To My World_Einar Erlander\nHip Hop Bed - 7\nSink Or Swim_John Glenn Kunkel\nOne Night_Per Ljungqvist, Donnie Dragon\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
