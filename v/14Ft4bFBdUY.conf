Check out Mark's 5 top tips for the ultimate time trial bike setup üö¥\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/r\n\nAll triathletes can improve their triathlon bike leg and strive for that ultimate TT setup. Mark picks out his 5 tips that will give you the greatest time saving on race day. \n\n- Hydration Setup - drinks can be stored on the frame, between the handlebars, behind the saddle and even on our back. Aero bottles between the handlebars with a straw are the best option for ease of access and efficiency.\n- Mechanical Maintenance - a good level of bike maintenance prevents you throwing away the gains in power you have made whilst training. The key moving parts to maintain are the chain, jockey wheels and bearings.\n- Gear Choice - increasing the size of the front chain ring to a 55t may enable you to feel more powerful and prevent you running out of gears on a fast course.\n- Tyres - a lighter and better quality tyre will both improve the responsiveness of the bike. A change in tyre width will change the feel of the bike and its comfort. A 25mm tyre will also improve your efficiency on the bike due to a lower rolling resistance compared to a 23mm tyre.\n- Wheels - deeper section wheels will improve your aerodynamics by reducing the amount of dirty air produced and are therefore a great upgrade to any TT setup.\n\nLet us know what you think is the most important aspect to the ultimate TT setup in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/q\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  What is the Global Triathlon Network? http://gtn.io/GTNExplained\nüìπ  The First Ever GTN Show http://gtn.io/GTNShow1\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
