description = "A good pair of running shoes is one of the most important pieces of kit for any triathlete. Here is GTN's guide to buying the perfect pair of run shoes for you!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/1Z\n\nChoosing the right pair of running shoes can be as complex as buying more expensive kit such as a bike. Every runner is different and requirements vary significantly therefore don't just buy the nice looking pair or the one your mate likes. It is important to buy the correct kit for you... the wrong shoes could lead to injury after many miles in them. \n\nThe first thing to look for is whether you overpronate, supinate or you have a neutral gait. This leads to choosing different types of shoe with differing levels of support. The next thing to decide is the level of support and cushioning your feet require. This varies between individuals and the distance that you will run in them. Beyond this, considerations include the life expectancy of the shoe and whether you predominantly run on the track, road or trail. If you take all of these into account you should be able to find the perfect shoe for you!\n\nWe hope you found these tips useful!
