description = "Check out Pieter Heemeryck's SCOTT Plasma TT triathlon bike. Pieter's best result on this bike was his win at Challenge Prague and he has ridden it to more great results since.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5U\n\nHere we are with Pieter Heemeryck's SCOTT Plasma TT, and Pieter himself, which is great.\n\nPieter, what's your best result you've had on this bike? \nBest result I think it was my winning Challenge Prague. There I had I think first bike's bit or maybe second ride was there so.\n\nAnd how long have you actually been riding this bike? \nI think it's starting the season, so 5 months.\n\nHow is this different than what you were riding before? \nYeah, it's the same bike. The only thing I changed was here. I've got now this bends, otherwise it was more straight, but I more like this ones.\n\nYou said you had a bike fit. Was that part of the change from the bike fits or? \nYeah, they saw it's more for me. It's more important to be more comfort and I like this position much more than the other.\n\nAlright, now we just have a quick look at you, and a few interesting bits and some bits you've said had made in the UK. Can you explain what you've got going on here and the reason for this very aerodynamic looking section?\nYeah, this is a part from Drag 2 Zero and it makes the bike more aerodynamic and I've got an inner tube, two tyre levers and a CO2 plectrum inside it so it's very aerodynamic and you don't have to put it after the bike or to do it with duct tape so it's very good stuff.\n\nAnother little piece you said that's come from the UK is your computer mount here. Talk me through this. What is this? Why do you have this exactly?\nI was searching for a good TT mount and I add all the others as the rim fell off. \n\nFor the bike, I mostly choose for the ZIPP 808, the new one, the NSW Series. If it's possible, I choose for the disc.\n\nAnd yeah, the tyres are always with me, 25mm Continentals. Not the fastest one, but I'm not so technical on the bike so I choose for more protection and I think it's the GP4000 S2. So yeah, it's not the fastest tyre but I like them the most.\n\nOkay, now you mentioned that you've changed your poles a little bit. What poles are you using and what shift has you got here?\nYeah, I think it's called Ski bends. Yeah, before it was more the flat ones. It's more aggressive but I found out if I am in this position more, more comfort that I can keep the butts longer, high, so that's why I choose for this one now. \n\nFor drive train, I choose Shimano Di2 and it's very good drive train. With it has the SRM. Also, the Shimano Race pedals and I've got 172.5mm cranks.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/5V\n\nMusic: \nEpidemic Sound\nREDWOOD- RAYNIE\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Climb On A Tri Bike - http://gtn.io/climbtribike\nüìπ  5 Essential Swim Skills To Master - http://gtn.io/SwimSkills\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
