title = "How To Warm Up Before Your Run | Get The Most Out Of Your Running Workout"
description = "Before I start any type of training, I always make sure that my body is fully prepared for the activity ahead. It can be a little bit tempting to cut your warmup short, especially when you're tight for time, but you will get far more out of your training session if you're thoroughly warm and loosened up. \n\nThe key part to a warmup is getting warm, so there's no harm in starting with a few extra layers and you can always take them off as you go. It's a bit chilly today, so I've borrowed this beanie from the GTN guys. \n\nWell, to get us started, I'm gonna warm up by going into a steady jog and then building through it as I go. I'm back from the jog, and I'm nice and warm. Now it's important to do some dynamic stretches. \n\nSo start off, I'm just gonna do some leg swings. Forwards and backwards. Make sure you find something to hold onto so you can really focus on getting the action properly rather than losing your balance. Lamppost will do, or find a friend. The idea is opening up your hips, getting them ready to be able to run. \n\nNow onto full body twists. Great for rotation and opening up your hips. It's important that one foot goes in front of the other and then you alternate, and don't forget you've always gotta go back in the other direction. \n\nHigh skipping is all about the height. You can use your arms to help, and you want to get your knees and hips to 90 degrees, and this will make sure those glutes start firing. \n\nNow this one involves a little bit of coordination. Start with your arms at the top, you're gonna swing one forwards, one backwards, and then the other way. And if you're feeling really coordinated, you can add in a clap at the top. It's another brilliant exercise for rotation and getting your body fully warmed up. \n\nOn to side steps. Now it's important to use your arms as well because you want the blood flowing to the whole of your body. And the key for this is getting as much height as it is distance. And don't forget, you need to go in both directions as well. \n\nNow before you start this, just check behind you that it's safe to go. And then, the idea is running backwards really firing those glutes. But it'll also help open up the front of your hips. \n\nWe're almost there, it's just high knees again. It's about reactivity, speed, and keeping a really nice upright posture. Staying with speed and reactivity, this helps open up your hips, but really getting your feet reacting off the ground. You don't need to move forwards fast, just need to use your legs fast. Now if you followed this warmup, you will now be fired up and ready to nail that session. But just remember, when you finish, a cool down is just as important.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/4P\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/4Q\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  8 Key Stretches To improve Your Flexibility - http://gtn.io/8Stretches\nüìπ  Kenyan Hills Running Session - http://gtn.io/4y\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
