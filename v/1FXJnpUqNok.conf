description = "It's just gone half six on the morning of the race, I'm super excited, but I'm obviously quite nervous too. It's nervous in a different way from normal because I'm usually gunning it for the podium or to beat the other athletes. But, this is really different. This is almost like I'm scared what I'm about to do to myself because I'm not very good at holding back. I'm not massively prepared and fit, so I'm actually slightly nervous I'm about to blow up on this...\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/96\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nI've just arrived in Malta ahead of my first ever XTERRA triathlon, an off-road triathlon, and actually my first race since retiring from being a professional triathlete. I've kind of enjoyed myself since retiring so this is off the back of pretty little training actually. And apparently, I've thrown myself into the deep end because this is one of the toughest XTERRA courses on the circuit. We're out here for week of filming ahead of the race, so probably not the most ideal prep, but I'm really excited to race my first ever XTERRA. Everyone tells me how fun they are so I can't wait to get stuck in. We are good to go - XTERRA Malta, here I come... üèÜ\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/95\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Ironman Triathlon World Championships Vlog - http://gtn.io/KonaVlog\nüìπ Ironman Triathlon 70.3 World Championships Vlog - http://gtn.io/ChatVlog\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCar Door Close 15 - SFX Producer\nDream Bigger - Johannes BornloÃàf\nForest Birds Chirp 2 - SFX Producer\nGot Real - Splasher!\nHotshot 2 - Niklas AhlstroÃàm\nI Follow Your Heartbeat (Ahlstrom Remix) (Instrumental Version) - Kevin Andersson\nMonologue - Splasher!\nShlow Motion Pt .1 - oomiee\nSidney - Luwaks\nTenderness 11 - Niklas Gustavsson\nTime To Wake Up (Ahlstrom Remix) - Cacti\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
