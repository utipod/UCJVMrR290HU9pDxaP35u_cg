description = "Running on the track can have many benefits as part of a structured training plan. And it can also make your run training a little bit more social.\n\nIf you've never run on a track before you might think it's a bit daunting but it's not. You don't have to be fast to run on a track, anyone can do it. But there's a few things you need to know before you step onto the track, which we'll cover in this video. We're here to guide you through the dos and don'ts so you're ready to take your training to the next level. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5S\n\nThanks to Club La Santa for the locations used in this shoot.\n\nSo it's worth considering your clothing when you're heading to the track and it's important to feel comfortable but have enough range of movement so you can run fast. And the best thing about a track, you're going around in circles so you can just take anything extra that you don't need off and leave it in a pile that's pretty safe.\n\nYeah, and I think for the warmup you wanna leave a few layers on because literally you want to warm up during that phase. But when it comes to the main session, you probably wanna strip down into a t-shirt and shorts 'cause you're gonna warmup quite quickly. But then after your session you're gonna get pretty cold so put those layers back on.\n\nIf you've seen athletics on the television you might think oh my gosh I need to go and buy some spikes in order to run on the track. But you don't actually need to. Your ordinary trainers, something like this will do the job perfectly. Probably best to avoid cross country shoes because you don't actually need any extra grip on the track. I think I'd reinforce that point on spikes as well. You don't need them. For me it's a big no no. You're probably gonna cause yourself more injury problems than what's good. And if you wanna feel that little bit faster just wear some racing flats.\n\nNow before you head to your local track, it's probably worth just checking the time table. It works a little bit like a swimming pool. So you might find it's just free running open to anyone, and you can go and have a go. Other times clubs might have hired it out. And if there is a club why don't you contact them and see if you can join in and you might make some new running friends and make it a little bit more fun.\n\nDefinitely and also if you finish working, it's dark outside and you're a bit worried about running on the street, then a floodlit track is probably gonna be the best place for you to run. \n\nSo as always, when you're coming somewhere new, you need to think about safety. And the rules of track are to begin with, you need to be going anti-clockwise.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/5T\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nBaby Without You (Instrumental Version) - Loving Caliber\nFollow You (Instrumental Version) - Tobias Fagerstr√∂m\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Run Like A Pro - http://gtn.io/RunPro\nüìπ  Kenyan Hills Running Session - http://gtn.io/4y\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
