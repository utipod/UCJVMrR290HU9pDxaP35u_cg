description = "In order to give yourself the best chance of a perfect race you‚Äôll need to know the course inside out. In this video we‚Äôre going to be explaining how to do a pre race course recce. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/d0\n\nMake the most of what is available to you when it comes to a course recce. Look at the map the event provide either online or in your entry pack. This isn‚Äôt always that clear so check it against google maps with the satellite mode or even an OS map so you can check the contours. Talking of contours if you can look at the profile and the numbers for altitude, sometimes on a short course it can look more daunting than it actually is or vice versa. Don‚Äôt forget to check how many loops and the scale of the map too.\n\nBeyond this, try and speak to locals who might be aware of the route or even better, fellow athletes who‚Äôve raced it before. Also, make sure you attend the race briefing, especially if doing a race for the first time. \n\nHaving said all of that, you can‚Äôt beat actually getting out on the course and seeing it for yourself! \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/d1 \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Complete A Swim Recce Like A Pro | Swimming Tips For Triathlon - http://gtn.io/SwimRecce\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCoffee And Unicorns - Henyao\nNeopolitin - Guustavv\nPREL Glitch 14 - SFX Producer\nPREL Glitch Static 6 - SFX Producer\nToo Unusual - Yomoti\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
