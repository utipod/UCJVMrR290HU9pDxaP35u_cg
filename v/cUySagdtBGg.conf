title = "Top 10 Incredible Triathlon Records Of 2017"
description = "2017 has been an amazing year in the triathlon world. There's been some impressive performances, and even some records broken. So here are some of the records of 2017. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5n\n\nOkay, I'm going to go straight in on the Ironman record, and we're talking IRONMAN branded, rather than just iron-distance record. And in case you missed it, Tim Don absolutely crushed it at IRONMAN Brazil earlier this year. He did it in an incredible time of seven hours and 40 minutes, breaking Lionel Sanders' previous record of seven hours and 44 minutes, set only last year at IRONMAN Arizona. Now, another little fact for you here, this made Tim member number 44 to the Sub-8 hour club. And we were really looking forward to watching Tim at the IRONMAN World Championships in Kona, considering the form he was in, but sadly, he was knocked off his bike just a few days before the race. But we are pleased to say that he is recovering well from the incident. And hopefully we'll look forward to seeing him back in 2018. \n\nWhilst we're talking about the IRONMAN World Champs, we certainly can't do a records video without talking about Patrick Lange. After breaking Mark Allen's 27 year old run course record, at last year's IRONMAN World Champs, he came back again this year, and broke the overall course record. He did it in an incredible time of eight hours, one minute and 40 seconds, breaking Craig Alexander's previous record of eight hours and three minutes, set in 2011. \n\nWell, another record was broken in the same race, but this time it was on the bike by Cameron Wurf. He was the first into T2 while shattering Normann Stadler's four hour 18 bike course record, set in 2006. Wurf beat it by almost six minutes, but interestingly, he wasn't the only person to go under the previous record. Both Lionel Sanders and Sebastian Kienle both beat Stadler's previous record. But nobody could match ex-pro cyclist, Cameron Wurf, on the day. \n\nFlora Duffy, well what a year she has had. By winning the WTS Grand Final in Rotterdam, she became the lady with the most ever WTS wins in one year. That came to a grand total of six in 2017, beating Gwen Jorgensen's previous record of five. Now, she did them at Yokohama, Leeds, Hamburg, Edmonton, Stockholm and Rotterdam. \n\nAnd another record that Flora broke this year was in Yokohama, where she had the biggest ever winning margin in a WTS event. She won by an amazing one minute and 51 seconds. Now that's quite impressive, considering just the level of competition you have in WTS events, and actually just how short the events are too. \n\nOver in New Zealand it was Dougal Allan that won the iconic Challenge Wanaka for a second year running. And in doing so, he set a new bike course record and an overall course record.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/5o\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nWah What's Up 3 - Anders Both√©n\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  10 Things You Need To Know About Kona - http://gtn.io/10KonaFacts\nüìπ  Bike Tech From The ITU Grand Final In Rotterdam - http://gtn.io/RotterdamTech\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
