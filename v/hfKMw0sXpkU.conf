title = "Fasted Vs Fuelled | What's The Best Way To Fuel For Morning Training?"
description = "The idea of fasted training isn't anything new. In fact, many of the top athletes have practised it for years. That said, it hasn't come without its scepticism or opposition to the training method. Yeah, and you might well have heard about it, but maybe you're not quite sure how to go about it or whether it's even advised. So we're going to go and speak to an expert to find out a little bit more.\n\nWe are here with professional dietician Renee McGregor and Renee's actually worked with some of the top athletes out there, international athletes, and we really want to pick your brain, Renee, on what is fasted training.\n\nSo fasted training is a really important part of most athletes' training week. I would never use it for an athlete in terms of weight loss, but definitely to help them be able to utilise their fat stores more efficiently. That's what you tend to be wanting to use it for.\n\nSo when would we fit fasted training into our training programme? And how often?\n\nSo the ideal time would actually be breakfast, just before breakfast, because obviously you've got that natural fast from your evening meal before you eat again in the morning and that just makes it easy. You can wake up, go and do your session, and then come back and have your breakfast. But for some people, that doesn't work. For some people, you know, if they have to go to work and they've got a really early start, that's just not gonna happen. So they have to fit it in during the day and that's fine. The main focus will be about making sure you're carb-depleted when you're doing it in that way. So you need to make sure you've had four to six hours gap between your last carbohydrate-based meal or snack. And you can do it in that way as well. In terms of how often, you have to be really careful. Some people will think they'll do it every single day and that is not good for the immune system. So I tend to recommend no more than three sessions a week fasted. And also ensuring that you don't really do too many of the longer distance stuff. I mean, obviously, those athletes that are doing Ironman, half-Ironman, they maybe get away with up to two hours of fasted training, but beyond that, I'd start taking some fuel on.\n\nAnd so are we keeping this purely low intensity? Or can we put intensity in there, or is that not advised?\n\nAbsolutely low intensity. So if you're looking at it from a heart rate point-of-view, you don't want to be working more than 60% to 70% of your maximum heart rate. If you do perceived exertion, then you're looking at six or seven out of 10, max. And also going any harder than that, the problem you're gonna have is, one, you probably can't. Because in order to, you know, work at a very high intensity, the body needs carbohydrate for fuel. So by doing it, what you're doing is you're putting your body under more stress, you're more likely to get injured, you're more likely to get ill.\n\nWell, that was certainly interesting and clearly, a fasted training isn't just a myth. And if it's used correctly, it can be beneficial to you.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3p\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/3q\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Train When You Have No Time - http://gtn.io/TrainWithNoTime\nüìπ  How To Increase Your Run Distance - http://gtn.io/RunFurther\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
