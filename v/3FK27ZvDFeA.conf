description = "Punctures! They‚Äôre everyone‚Äôs nightmare, particularly during a race. But a question we've been asked again and again, which is quicker to fix and replace - a clincher or a tubular tyre? GTN put it to the test!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/99\n\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nIt‚Äôs race-day and you suddenly hear that dreaded ‚Äòpsssssssst‚Äô - it‚Äôs time to jump off your bike and fix that tyre. \n\nIn this video, we‚Äôre going to assume you don‚Äôt have a sealant in the tyre already, otherwise you probably wouldn‚Äôt have got the puncture in the first place. And we‚Äôre not going to bother with a pitstop or other sealant. We‚Äôre going to go for a full replacement. After all, if you‚Äôre doing a long distance event, this can sometimes be a better solution in the long run even if it does feel like it takes a more time repairing.\n\nSo, Mark times himself repairing a clincher tyre, by replacing the inner tube within the tyre followed by repairing a tubular tyre by making a full replacement. \n\nWhich do you think will be quicker to change, let us know your predictions in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/98\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Fix A Bike Puncture On Race Day - http://gtn.io/PunctureRepair\nüìπ Clipless Vs.
