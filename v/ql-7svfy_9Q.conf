title = "How To Get Your Bike Ready For Your Next Triathlon - With Pro Triathlon Team Mechanic"
description = "When it comes to race day, it's not just about getting yourself ready. You also need to get your bike ready, so we're going be running through a few of the main points to get your bike race ready, and we're going be getting help from Tom. Tom is from BMC Vifit Sports' professional triathlon team, and he is their bike mechanic. He's going be running through the why's and I'm gonna be running through the how's.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/6o\n\nBefore we get started, are there any dos and don'ts when you're getting your bike race day ready?\n\nYes, the first thing I like to say is it's important that one month or so before the race, you don't change your position or things like that. No major changes, because it's not good to race with a different position than you were riding before. Second thing, is when you start working on your bike, changing wheels, gears, things like that, don't do it one day before the race, because if it's not working out, then you might end up in a panic and a spot of trouble as you won't have time to solve it.\n\nWheels - of course, wheels are important on a TT bike and triathlon bike. You might have another set for the race instead of the training wheels, so you maybe will swap them. The choice of wheels will depend on the course, the wind, how the weather conditions are looking. The guys on the team have three different kinds of wheels. They can choose between different types of rims or discs.\n\nTyres - There is a lot to say about tyres, but normally, if you have a second wheel set for race day, you will have also a pair of nice race tyres on it with less rolling resistance than the training tyres. There are, of course, different widths of tyres. You have the 23, 25, even sometimes 28 now, but it also depends on how the surface is where you're racing. A wider tyre also has a better the rolling resistance.\n\nBeyond the wheels and tyres , it's important to check the brakes and gears on your race bike. Tom takes you through why it is important and Mark takes you through how to adjust each of these. Finally you want your bike to be quick, and to look good, so make sure you give it a good clean and polish before race day!\n\nIf you found this video useful, give it a thumbs up and don't forget to share it with your triathlon friends!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/6n\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCristaux - AndreÃÅ Aguado\nTotem Waves - Daniel Gunnarsson\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  GTN Monday Maintenance - http://gtn.io/L\nüìπ  What To Carry On The Bike For Race Day - http://gtn.io/whattotake\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
