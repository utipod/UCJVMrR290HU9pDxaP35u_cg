title = "How To Choose Your First Triathlon Event"
description = "Combining swim, bike and run into one event, a triathlon, is becoming more and more popular. With so many choices on offer, here is how to choose your first event!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/64\n\nWhen working out what distance to enter as your first triathlon, it is important to consider your current fitness, and the time scale you have to train for this event. A shorter distance triathlon is easier to complete as your first. However, if you are more suited to endurance, there is nothing to say you can't complete a longer distance event straight away.\n\nIt is easy to get drawn into the big, well known events for your first race and that is fine if its what gets you motivated but there are many smaller events out there. These events are just as fun, and often cheaper. Many newcomers will opt for the small local races to test the water and therefore doesn't put the same amount of pressure on the day. Either way, it's important to choose a triathlon that excites you!\n\nIf you are someone who finds the thought of open water swimming daunting then don‚Äôt worry, you can give yourself a more pleasant introduction to the sport and search for a pool based triathlon for your first event. There are plenty of triathlons that start in the comfort of a heated pool. You‚Äôll have the added security of a lane rope to grab if you need to and a wall to push off at the end of each length. Plus all you need is a swim or tri suit which will help make the transition easier too.\n\nDo a little research on the race profile before signing up. If you know you struggle on the hills, perhaps avoid a super hilly course for your very first race. The same goes for a technical twisty turny type course, try to find something smooth and flowing if you‚Äôre not so confident with your bike handling skills.\n\nThe terrain is not limited to just the bike, check out the run course for the same reasons with regards to the hills but also the surface. The bike course has to be on asphalt unless a cross triathlon where as the running can be cross country, track, road or a mix of all. It is worth checking this out so you can tailor your training a little and have appropriate footwear. \n\nDoing your first race or any race is made that bit more enjoyable if you have friends there to support or to compete alongside. Maybe ask what event people in your club are doing, seeing a familiar face will automatically help with pre race nerves and the post race celebrations. \n\nIf you found this video helpful, make sure to share it with someone who is thinking about their first event.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/65\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nAnyone - Maiwan\nBamboo - Jack Elphick\nBeat Me 1 - Jonatan JaÃàrpehag\nHold Up - Fasion\nI Hold On (Instrumental Version) - Chris Coral\nShade - Daxten\nSidney - Henrik Olsson\nUnder The Stars - Squiid\nZebra Style 2 - Martin Landh\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Speak Like A Triathlete | Triathlon Jargon Buster - http://gtn.io/TriJargon\nüìπ  7 Unwritten Rules Of Triathlon - http://gtn.io/7UnwrittenRules\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
