description = "This week, we‚Äôre going to be running you through how and why you should be doing a post-race analysis after your next triathlon.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/c0\n\nIn association with Training Peaks - http://gtn.io/TrainingPeaks\n\nThe idea behind doing a post-race analysis is to evaluate your race performance, and to determine what worked and what didn‚Äôt, where your strengths lie, and what needs tweaking. You may even find you‚Äôre doing some of this already without realising!\n\nYeah, at the end of the day, there is no point doing race after race without taking a step back and working out how to improve. No matter how good you are, everyone should be doing this. You‚Äôll find Flora Duffy, Jan Frodeno, Alistair Brownlee and Lionel Sanders all doing this.\n\nBy doing a post-race analysis, it will actually help to dictate what you do in your day-to-day training, and allow you to get more out of yourself. So today, we‚Äôre going to be explaining what a post-race analysis is, what it should include, and getting some expert advice.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nFor more information on this topic, check out the following links from training peaks:\n- How to Do a Proper Post-Race Data Analysis - http://gtn.io/TPRaceAnalysis\n- Power Analysis: Lionel Sanders at the 2017 IRONMAN World Championship - http://gtn.io/TPSanders2017\n- Q&A: Ben Hoffman‚Äôs ‚ÄúYear in Review‚Äù and Look Ahead - http://gtn.io/TPHoffmanYear\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/b-\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Triathlon Training Explained | What Is Critical Swim Speed? - http://gtn.io/TTECritcalSwim\n\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
