title = "5 Climbing Tips For Your Next Hilly Triathlon"
description = "A challenging course profile can be a big talking point going into your next race. But if you train for it properly, a nice hilly course can be to your advantage.\n\nYou'll find most races will give you a course profile before so you know how much climbing you've got and at what gradient. So we've put together some tips to help for your next hilly course.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5O\n\nThanks to Club La Santa for the locations used in this shoot.\n\nWhen you come to a longer climb like this, pacing becomes paramount. So we've brought you to an iconic climb, here at Fire Mountain in Lanzarote. This is one of the first climbs you get to in the Ironman course and pacing this right will bode well for the rest of the race.\n\nBy pacing we mean controlling your physical effort, so ideally you want to be able to maintain the same effort throughout the hill or even better maybe save a little bit so you can push a bit more when you get to the top.\n\nYou can also use long hills to train in your aero position. This will promote smoother pedalling because you can't use your aero bars to pull on so you'll be isolating just your leg muscles. We've seen the likes of Bradley Wiggins using long hills in training to get into the aero position. And you do that simply because you can't stop pedalling and roll backwards, it's a constant effort and it also improves your core stability and strength. \n\nSo long climbs are an ideal opportunity to do some fuelling. Because you're not gonna come out of that arrow position and it be detrimental to your speed. Also, you're going to be riding a slower pace so if you've got a tricky gel to get out of your back pocket it's an easy opportunity to do so. But also just make sure that it's a fairly gradual climb because you don't want your heart rate to be really high and then trying to digest and fuel. But also you don't want to be doing it on those descents, and you'll need both hands back on the bars.\n\nGear selection on a climb is really important. Now ideally you want to stay in a higher cadence so a lower gear so you can spin. You keep more of a natural flow and it'll feel more comfortable but also when you come to the run you're less likely to feel it as much as if you're in a big gear. Being comfortable on a long climb becomes really important so you can maintain that efficient position throughout.\n\nSo we see a lot of pros holding the middle of the bars when climbing. You can certainly pull on the back a little bit to generate force to get over the harder climbs, and if you need a bit more stability you can come onto the outsides as well. If you need to get out of the saddle.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/5P\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nDivergent - Ooyy\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Descend On A TT Bike - http://gtn.io/TTDescending\nüìπ  TT Bike Vs Road Bike On A Climb -\n http://gtn.io/bestbikeforclimbing\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
