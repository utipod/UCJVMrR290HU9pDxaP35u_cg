Maybe it's not something you've ever thought about, but if you're going on a longer run, you might want the extra security, just in case! With that in mind, Heather has been exploring all the options for you!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/E1\n\nWe do seem to be attached to our mobile phones in our day to day life, when you’ve got a handbag or jean back pocket it’s not a problem, but when it comes to carrying your phone on a run it poses some challenges.\n\nAs we started to cover longer distances we realised we needed to find a way to have it as back up.
