description = "Welcome back to week 5-6 of our Couch to 5k programme! This one is all about keeping those legs moving above the 5-minute mark, working on a consistent form, and adding some stretches into your routine. Let's catch up with Pippa and see how she's getting on\n\nView our full Couch to 5K plan here üëâ  https://gtn.io/C25KPlan\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/Fu\n\nDuring Week 3-4 we learnt to focus on a comfortable cadence, maintain steady breathing and keep aiming for that full 5 minutes of uninterrupted running! If you really really need to, split the full 5 minutes in half with a 30-second jog or walk, before carrying on with another run. Heather's got some great exercises to do if you've got some new feelings in your body after your runs too! \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/Ft\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Watch couch to 5k week 1 here: https://gtn.io/CouchTo5Kep1\nüìπ and catch up on week 2-3 here: https://gtn.io/C25Kep2\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nAntidoto - El Neon\nATM (Instrumental Version) - Pabi Sonko\nBestie (Instrumental Version) - Pabi Sonko\nCielo - Timothy Infinite\nHow to Treat You Right (Instrumental Version) - Mia Pfirrman\nKill the Lights (Instrumental Version) - BLAEKER\nLas Ramblas - El Neon\nLove U Better (Instrumental Version) - Lola Are\nPaz - Timothy Infinite\nSombra - Timothy Infinite\nToo Rough around the Edges (Instrumental Version) - Snake City\nTrofeo - Timothy Infinite\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
