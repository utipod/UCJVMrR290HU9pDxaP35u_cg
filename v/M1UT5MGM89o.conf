description = "This is Matt Bottrill's Giant Trinity Advanced Pro and his Giant Trinity Advanced Pro TT. Check out both of these bikes and the differences  between Matt's triathlon and UCI legal setups!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7D\n\nWe check out Matt Bottrill's Giant Trinity Advanced Pro and his Giant Trinity Advanced Pro TT and explore the differences between the triathlon setup and the UCI legal setup. The reason for the two bikes is that Matt isn‚Äôt really a triathlete (though he has dabbled), he is in fact an ex-pro cyclist.\n\nMatt is a bit of a guru when it comes to time trialling, aerodynamics, and just going fast. He has coached Tim Don to the current Ironman record, Lucy Charles, Will Clarke, Susie Cheetham, Rachel Joyce, and Timo Bracht to his Challenge Roth win. Matt‚Äôs own accoladesinclude a 10mile TT PB of 17min40s and he was the UK TT champion for the 10, 25, 50 and 100mile. And, just a couple of years ago he decided to give triathlon a go!\n\nSo, we thought it would be really interesting to see how a seriously fast time trialist has adapted to triathlon. What are the differences between his pure TT bike, and his triathlon bike? And are there some tips that we could all take away?\n\nIf you liked this video, don';t forget to give it a thumbs up and share with your triathlon and cycling friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link  - http://gtn.io/7C\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Lucy Charles' Specialized S-Works Shiv Pro Triathlon Bike - http://gtn.io/LucyCharlesShiv\nüìπ How To Train With Power - http://gtn.io/trainwithpower\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
