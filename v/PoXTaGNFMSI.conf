title = "How To Get The Ideal Bike Position | Ask GTN Anything With Magnus B√§ckstedt"
description = "I'm joined by Magnus Backstedt, ex-pro cyclist and former IRONMAN triathlete. Magnus, I gather you now specialise in bike fits.\n\nSo we've got some great questions from you, the viewers, that we're gonna ask you. We're gonna start off with one that Stan Cauler has sent in on Facebook and Stan is asking: How can one improve the bike fit when changing upgrading parts on the bike?\n\nSo, changing the parts on the bike, I think the only thing you can really look forward to improve on your fit then is getting more customizable handlebars. Handlebars can move and change in many different ways. Saddles, yes they can be an upgrade in terms of your fit, I also think at that point you need to see someone professional with the right softwares to help you decide whether that actually helps your position so if your pelvic rotation is in the right way, if you actually can take the pressure from that saddle in the right way and maintain a stable position.\n\nNext one we have here from Peter York on Twitter: How do you know if your seat is too high?\n\nA lot of the time you'll see that your pelvis is rocking on the bike from left to right and if you're gonna go for a very very simple basic measurement of understanding whether your seat is roughly in the right position, just put your heel on the pedal, get someone to hold the bike so you're not standing with your foot on the ground and sort of trying to do it because then you're not actually level on the bike. You need to sit on the bike properly, put both your heels on the bike on the pedals and see if you can just about reach it when it's at it's lowest point.\n\nShawn Farley on Twitter: Does fitting the bike with a shorter stem to better fit your reach measurement negatively impact the handling? That is, is a tri bike with a shorter stem harder to control than one with a longer stem?\n\nNo, not really. The tri bike tends to be the extension on the skis and where your elbows are placed on the pads that changes how the bike handles. Yes, the longer the stem is, the more stable the bike will be. The harder it is turn it in as far as you need to, you can basically force the bike into a corner and most of the bikes like the one that you have here is on an all integrated sort of system these days so it doesn't make too big a difference. On a road bike, massive difference.\n\nStegin on Twitter saying: How to determine the position where to put the plate of the pedal on your shoes?\n\nNow, the easiest way to do this is basically place your foot on a normal sheet of paper, draw a line around the outside of your foot, take and mark the joint of the ball of your foot by your big toe and the same thing on the outside of the- Your fifth metatarsal, your little toe.\nYeah, the little toe, yeah. Draw a line between the two and then draw a line from your big toe to the back of your heel and that is the centre the cross that you're getting on that piece of paper is where the centre of the pedal spindle should be underneath your foot basically.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5a\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/5b\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Train Like A Pro On The Bike - http://gtn.io/BikeProTraining\nüìπ  Aero Bars Vs Drops - http://gtn.io/AeroBarsVsDrops\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
