title = "Ironman Lanzarote Predictions With Thorsten Radde | TriRating Explained"
description = "Ironman Lanzarote is a notoriously tough course course on the European triathlon calendar. Today we are joined by Thorsten Radde from TriRating to predict the results for the 2018 edition of IM Lanzarote!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/9U\n\nThorsten Radde:\nI do a comparison between the times that people finish, vs the times they did on other courses. By doing a bunch of maths then I can say how much a fast or slow time was because the guy or the girl had a good race, or a bad race, or how much was influenced by the fast or hard course. This allows me to come up with what I call the Course Rating, expressed as a time that a course, compared to a neutral course, is faster or slower. If you look at Lanzarote, for example, I think the course rating is around -18 minutes.\n\nEither I exactly hit the numbers, and then obviously it was easy to predict who would win, or I'm totally off and then that shows that numbers don't work at all. But, usually, you can narrow it down to a handful of athletes that do have a chance of winning a race. Sometimes it's an obvious one who's way ahead of everyone else, but for Lanzarote this year, it should be pretty close and interesting racing.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/9T\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ New Ironman Triathlon Pros To Watch in 2018 - http://gtn.io/NewIronmanPros\nüìπ Nikki Bartlett's Cerv√©lo P5 Pro Bike And Triathlon Kit - http://gtn.io/NBCerveloP5\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
