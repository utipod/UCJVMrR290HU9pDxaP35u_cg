description = "Here is GTN's guide to avoid that feeling of jelly legs and perfect running off the bike!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/7A\n\nWe expect our bodies to go from sitting on a bike predominantly using our legs to being upright holding our full body weight and propelling us forward at our usual running pace - but without preparation and practise this can go horribly wrong. \n\nBefore you get on the bike spend a bit of time working out the best position for you. You need to find the happy balance between comfort, being aerodynamic, and being able to produce power. If you ticked the latter two but comfort is lacking then getting off the bike will at first seem a massive relief but it will detriment your run. \n\nCycling for a long duration at an intense effort will tighten up your hip flexors and often your back, if you can find a position that rotates your body forwards and keeps your hips more open it will make transferring to running that much easier. \n\nIt‚Äôs easy to to let your running form drop when you start out after the cycle. With tight hip flexors, it‚Äôs easy to to get a little hunched and get into more of a shuffle rather than a run. Focus on keeping your shoulders upright and open. This will automatically open up your hips and allow for a more efficient longer stride.\n\nIf you liked this video, don't forget to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/7z\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Run Fast Off The Bike | GTN's Ultimate Tempo Brick Workout - http://gtn.io/brickworkout\nüìπ How To Train For Your First Triathlon - http://gtn.io/TrainForFirstTri\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nSick And Tired (Instrumental Version) - Mad Modishi\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
