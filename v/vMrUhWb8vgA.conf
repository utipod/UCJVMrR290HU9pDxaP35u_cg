title = "No More Triathlon Mass Starts!? | The GTN Show Ep. 58"
description = "Welcome to the GTN Show! This week Heather checks out all the action from the WTS Grand Final  and looks into the mass start debate after a rather significant disqualification on the weekend! As well as this, we discuss the the latest racing news, triathletes being banned from restaurants and the new marathon world record.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/dW\n\nMuch to the Great Britain's team disappointment, Alistair Brownlee was DQ‚Äôd from the ITU Grand Final on the Gold Coast as a result of going the wrong side of a swim buoy marker. The swim on the Gold Coast was tough, with choppy sea conditions for both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs race. Add to that the large fields of around 60 and it looked like a washing machine from the drone shots. Due to an inconsistent season, Brownlee found himself with a less favourable position on the pontoon which then meant he was further back in the field once they reached the buoys. You can see the chaos as athletes struggle to keep their line whilst making it around the buoys.  Initially Alistair was given a 15‚Äù penalty, but after the race, this was changed to a DQ. \n\nThe pro fields in long distance racing are generally much smaller and being over a longer distance, are typically less ferocious at the beginning. However, there can be thousands of age group athletes competing in a race and including some weaker swimmers. So, it‚Äôs been interesting to see Ironman introduce the rolling start for the age group races over the last few years and to a mixed reception.\n\nDoes introducing a rolling start just make the swim easier? Is that fair to the stronger swimmers? This is a debate that will continue for a while but for now, we want to find out your opinion on the topic - let us know in the comments below!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/dV\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ 5 Supplements For Triathletes | An Introduction To Nutritional Supplements In Triathlon - http://gtn.io/Supplements\nüìπ GTN Unboxing: NEW Polar Vantage Multisport Watches - http://gtn.io/VantageUnboxing\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nEnd Of The Beginning 3 - Peter Sandberg\nGoofy Moments 17 - Magnus Ringblom\nJust My Luck - Matt Large\nKing Masa - Axel Ljung\nOnce Upon A Time In Detroit 2 - Axel Ljung\nSwimmingly - Dylan Sitts\nThe Tribe Has Spoken 1 - Gavin Luke\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
