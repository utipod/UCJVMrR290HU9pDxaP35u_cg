title = "5 Bike Maintenance Mistakes Every Triathlete And Cyclist Should Avoid"
description = "Okay, we've all been there. We try to make a quick fix on our bike, only to make it worse and end up costing us more money. Now that's painful, but that's not the type of painful I'm talking about today. I'm talking about the kind of mistake that leaves you jumping around in agony, probably saying a few words that I can't repeat in this video. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/5g\n\nSo first up, the knuckle shaver. It's a classic. These horrible chain ring teeth have a habit of finding themselves in your knuckles, and if you've managed to avoid it until now, well, you're very lucky. But if you have done it before, you're probably not gonna be rushing to do it again. The most common cause is when you're trying to remove your pedals, and it tends to be in desperate times when the peddles just won't release or you're in a rush perhaps. \n\nAnd it happens when you position the spanner above the chain rings. And you're probably gonna have mixed emotions when you do actually land your knuckles in the chain rings because on one hand, you will have just released your pedals. But then on the other hand, well, actually the same hand, you will have just taken a chunk of skin out of your knuckles. So to avoid it, I'd suggest putting your chain into the outer ring, so that then the teeth are actually covered. And then, rotate the pedals around to the base and place a spanner in like so. \n\nFrayed cables. Now these cabling caps not only make the cables look neater, they also save us a tonne of pain. If you lose the cabling caps off the end of the cable, the cables can end up fraying, or they can even break partway along. And they turn the cable into some kind of wolverine claw. And similar to the chain rings, they have habit of finding our skin. And they may look fine and maybe not that painful, but trust me, they can even make grown men feel very sorry for themselves. So if you do end up losing the cable ends, I suggest trying to replace them as soon as possible, and they are very cheap, after all. \n\nFingers in spokes, this is making me squeamish just thinking about it. Landing your fingers in the spokes of a spinning wheel. Yeah, enough said. And fortunately, it's something I haven't done, but I know plenty of people that have. And when you're intensely concentrating on the alignment of your gears and the fine adjustments, you can forget that the wheel is spinning and just how close your fingers are getting to the spokes. And in most cases, it's just a quick glance, but it's enough to hurt. So my suggestion is make sure that the wheel stops spinning when you make adjustments to your gears. Missing things with a hammer. \n\nNow it's rare we suggest taking a hammer to your bike. In fact, just don't. But there's some things that need a delicate tap, and because you're being so careful, you tend to have your hands close to the object that needs hammering. And you miss and hit your hand. Yeah, we've all seen the cartoons. It's not pleasant. Don't do it. \n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/5h\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Remove And Change Your Cassette - http://gtn.io/ChangeCassette\nüìπ How To Ride In The Wind - http://gtn.io/rideinwind\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
