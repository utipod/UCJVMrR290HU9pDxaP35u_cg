title = "Are Ironman Triathlons Too Short? | The GTN Show Ep. 65"
description = "Welcome to the GTN Show - coming up we have record breakers to discuss, prize winners to announce and more of your pain caves to reveal. We also look at the 'ultimate triathlon', with a bit of a difference, and question whether Ironman is actually far enough...\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/fH\n\nBack at the beginning of the summer on June 1st British man Ross Edgley started off on a record attempting swim. He planned to swim the whole circumference of the UK mainland, a total of 1780 miles, something that had never been done before. He completed this impressive challenge on Sunday when he arrived into Margate, Kent where he was greeted by a huge crowd including IM champion Lucy Charles. In order to complete this he swam for up to 12 hours a day and during the 157 days at sea, he had to battle against external factors such strong tides, cold water, storms and jellyfish. \n\nUSA Triathlon and Ironman have come up with the idea of three-minute triathlons, yes you heard me, a triathlon that lasts just 3‚Äô, in order to introduce and encourage athletes who are new to the sport. It is part of the Time to Tri initiative at the Rock N Roll Marathon series across America. They are obviously targeting runners and hoping to get them to add the swim and bike and enter a triathlon. At each expo, the runners or spectators get the chance to do this 3‚Äô triathlon that consists of 60‚Äù of dryland swimming (on specialised trainer), 60‚Äù cycle on a spin bike and 60‚Äù run on a treadmill. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/fG \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nWorkout Whilst Ill? üìπ http://gtn.io/WorkoutIll\n5 Pre Season Fitness Tests üìπ http://gtn.io/5tests\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nAutomate - Ocean Jams\nCheap Flights - Dylan Sitts\nGrowing Still - Justnormal\nPullen Park - Sarah, the Illstrumentalist\nBlack Lies (Instrumental Version) - Daniel Kadawatha\nLost In America (Instrumental Version) - Daniel Kadawatha\nWash It Over Me (Instrumental Version) - Lvly\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
