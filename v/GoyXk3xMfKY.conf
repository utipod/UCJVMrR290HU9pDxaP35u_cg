description = "Flip-turns, or tumble turns are an essential freestyle swimming how-to skill. The flip turn has caused a lot of frustration for many swimmers and triathletes over the years. In this video, we‚Äôre going to explain the advantages of the flip turn and more importantly, how to do it!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/dz\n\nWhen learning to flip turn, we need to build our confidence, and for that, we‚Äôre going to do it away from any walls. That way you can practice and get used to somersaulting 360 degrees without the worry of colliding with anything.\n\nFor this we‚Äôre going to lie horizontal in the water, or as best as you can.  To start the flip movement, just pull forwards ever so slightly to give yourself a little momentum. Then draw your nose and chin towards your chest. By doing this, your head will actually direct your body and begin the rotation. At this point, you should bring your knees into your chest as tight as possible. By being in this compact position it will make the flip a lot easier and quicker. \n\nComplete as many of these turns as you need until you feel confident enough to almost do them eyes closed. Once you‚Äôre at that point and you‚Äôre feeling braver, you can gradually begin moving closer to the wall. You still don‚Äôt need to touch the wall, but it‚Äôs a great way to increase your spacial awareness and confidence of the skill.\n\nFollow along with the rest of this video and with a little practise, you'll be turning like a pro!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/dA\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Top 5 Essential Swim Skills To Master | Triathlon Swimming Tips For Beginners - http://gtn.io/SwimSkills\nüìπ How To Breathe When Swimming | Freestyle Swimming For Beginners - http://gtn.io/SwimBreathing\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nBang On - Johnny Berglund\nComfort Zone - Nebulae \nEtiqueta - Bassio\nHopeful Heavey Rock Trailer No6 - Johnny Berglund\nNo Limits - Matt Large\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
