description = "Mountain biking is a great way to improve your cycling skills, vary your triathlon training, and increase your confidence on the bike. There is a lot you can gain by getting out of our comfort zone and getting a bit dirty. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/9d\n\nIt might seem a little daunting to leave the smooth asphalt and the comfort of your perfectly tuned triathlon bike. But it‚Äôs something a lot of athletes do every year when they compete in XTERRA and other cross triathlon events. However, aside from race preparation, there are a lot of advantages to riding a mountain bike. \n\nThe skill benefits include improving your cornering and braking along with having more  control of the bike. Riding your mountain bike outside will likely result in a natural Fartlek session and cause you varying your cadence - a great way to keep workouts more interesting.\n\nThere really are loads of cross-overs and skills that mountain biking can add to our road riding. Many worry about the risk involved with riding off-road, but you don‚Äôt have to tear it down the trails, just ride within your own comfort and ENJOY IT!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/9c\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ What Is XTERRA Triathlon? - http://gtn.io/xterra-explained\nüìπ Roger Serrano's Protek Pro Bike & Xterra Triathlon Kit - http://gtn.io/SerranoProtek\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nJomo - Wesky\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
