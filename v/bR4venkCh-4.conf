title = "Road Vs Off-Road Running | Are You Training On The Best Terrain?"
description = "Running on the road and running off-road are very different when it comes to training. One is great for variation, injury prevention and switching off mentally, whereas the other is great for consistency and faster workouts. Which do you prefer?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/iU \n\nThere is no black and white rule when it comes to choosing off road or on road for your run training, we both mix the two. As a general rule, doing the longer less pace specific runs off road and the faster work on a harder surface such as road or track works well. And, if you are currently only running on one surface, then gradually mix it up to prevent injuries.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/iT \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ 4 Speed Workouts For Runners & Triathletes - Intermediate Level - https://gtn.io/4RunWorkouts  \nüìπ How To Run A Sub 4 Hour Marathon Race! | Running Training & Tips - https://gtn.io/MarathonSub4\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nBus Air Brakes - SFX Producer\nCar Horn Beep - SFX Producer\nCar Pass By 3 - SFX Producer\nCity New York 3 - SFX Producer\nCity New York 4 - SFX Producer\nComes Around STEMS DRUMS - OTE\nLosing My Mind STEMS DRUMS - Staffan CarleÃÅn\nMade By Man 2 - Anders BotheÃÅn\nPolice Siren 6 - SFX Producer\nThe Devil's Cup STEMS BASS - Conditional\nThe Devil's Cup STEMS DRUMS - Conditional\n\nMusic - licensed through Cue Songs:\nFree - The Entertainment\nPump It Up - The Bullet Proof Bomb\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
