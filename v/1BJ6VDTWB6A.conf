description = "Knowing how to safely and efficiently ride in a a group is great for training. As more and more draft-legal triathlon races appear, it's important to know group riding etiquette and the rules of the road.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/dm\n\nAs triathletes, we normally talk about how not to draft off another rider but, in this video, we‚Äôre actually going to tell you how to! \n\nTraditionally, triathlon races are non-drafting, meaning you must follow the rules of keeping your distance from other riders. But, there are more and more draft-legal races popping up that actually allow you to ride in a group so the skill of group riding is becoming pretty important. \n\nRiding in a group is also great for training and allows you to have fun with your mates whilst keeping a higher average pace than you would be able to on your own. However, if you want your friends to ride with you again, it's important that you know the unwritten rules and etiquette for riding in a group!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/dl\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Clip On Aero Bars Vs Drops | Which Is Faster For Your Next Triathlon? - http://gtn.io/AeroBarsVsDrops\nüìπ Draft Legal Triathlon Racing | Everything You Need To Know - http://gtn.io/DraftLegal\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nMotor Town - Da Tooby\nSo 90s 1 - Jan Chmelar\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
