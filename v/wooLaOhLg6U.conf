description = "In association with TrainingPeaks - http://gtn.io/TrainingPeaks\n\nOn this week's Triathlon Training Explained show we're looking at threshold swim pace and calculating your critical swim speed. Once your CSS is computed, this can be used to accurately pace your swim leg.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/aA\n\nOn this episode of TTE, we're looking into swim pacing for triathlon and effectively using your critical swim speed. We explain how to work out your CSS and then show you how to put this to use. Mark also shares his top threshold swimming sessions the T.T.T.T.T! \n\nSome triathletes may have a very quick short swim speed but a much slower longer one, other athletes could be the opposite. Your CSS figure will give a more accurate representation of your threshold pace and will enable you to work out your training zones.\n\nHave you worked out your critical swim speed?
