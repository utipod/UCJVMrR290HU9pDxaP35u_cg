title = "Pool Swim Stroke Vs Open Water Triathlon Stroke | How Do They Differ?"
description = "There are different styles of freestyle and frontcrawl. Mark favours a more open water and triathlon swim stroke, whereas Heather favours a pool stroke. Which is more efficient and which stroke should you be using in your next triathlon? \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/ck\n\nSo what is the difference between Mark and Heather's front crawl strokes? The over the water recovery phase has the most notable contrast. In the pool stroke, the elbow typically exits the water before the hand, and then it's fingers first as the hand enters the water. An open water stroke tends to be quicker, has a straighter arm recovery and is similar to a windmill action. \n\nWhich stroke do you use? \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/cl\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Wet Suit Vs Tri Suit - http://gtn.io/wetsuittrisuit\nüìπ http://gtn.io/OWSkillsPool\n\nMusic: \nES_Sugar Dream - Emil Axelsson.wav\nES_When The Dust Settles - Molife.wav\nHip Hop Bed - 7.wav\nES_Dazed Summer - Molife.wav\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
