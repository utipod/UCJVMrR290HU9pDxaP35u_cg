title = "Elastic Laces Vs Standard Laces ‚Äì Which Are Faster For Triathletes?"
description = "If you want faster triathlon times, one of the best places to look is the transition. Think of it as free speed. To improve at transitions, many triathletes use elastic laces in their runnings. But, are they really faster?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/ba\n\nThere are two schools of thought when it comes to elastic laces. Firstly, they make your transition quicker, so they must be quicker. And, secondly, yes, they do help for a faster transition, but they're maybe not the fastest laces for the actual running.\n\nToday, we're not going to put the actual running leg to the test. That's because there are just *too* many variables here. However, if you'd like to see that, make sure you leave us a comment and we'll get Mark to go to work and come up with some sort of test...\n\nSo, this video is all about the transition. Like we said, this is pretty much free speed since you're saving time rather than needing to get fitter to run faster.\n\nWe'd love to read your thoughts on this one, so make sure that you get stuck in down in the comments below.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/b9 \n\nWatch more on GTN...\nHacks to go faster in your next triathlon üìπ http://gtn.io/bb\nSocks vs No socks üìπ http://gtn.io/bc\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nAllways On The Go - Henrik Andersson\nAlright Come On - Sebastian Forslund\nBrooklyn Flava 2 (Sting) - Mattias Andreasson\nDazed Summer - Molife\nDone Feeling Blue (Instrumental Version) - Martin Carlberg\nFirst Kiss - Mondays\nPE Hit 14 - SFX Producer\nRed Chili Jam 3 (Sting Version) - Victor Olsson\nSafely - Homebody\nTennessee Strut 2 - Per-Anders Nilsson\nWhen I'm Gone (Instrumental Version) - Johan Svensson\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
