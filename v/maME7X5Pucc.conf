title = "8 Essential Tips To Get You Through Winter | Training Tips For Triathlon"
description = "For those of us in the northern hemisphere, winter is coming. And the combination of shorter daylight hours and colder temperatures makes motivating yourself for training that much harder.\n\nAnd you may have planned in an end of season break but once that's over there's a few things you'll want to consider to help make your training that little bit more enjoyable. So we've put together a list to help you with your training over the winter months.\n\nThis time of year the road conditions tend to worsen and that can be from the added rain or icy surfaces or sometimes extra debris on the roads.\n\nAnd with that in mind it's possibly worth considering switching from your summer, slick race tyres that probably aren't going to survive the winter months to something that's a bit more puncture resistant and with a bit more tread. And to make it that little bit more puncture resistant, you can actually add a sealant to the tyres too.\n\nThe weight of your tyres can make a difference as well. So, opting for 25 or 28 mil will mean you can run at a slightly lower pressure and therefore, you'll have a more comfortable ride as well as the added bonus of a little more grip.\n\nAnd with the increased risk of punctures over the winter, you may want to carry an extra spare inter tube. And with it being slightly colder for most of us over the winter, using a traditional pump can be tricky so you may want to try using a CO2 canister for a quicker fix.\n\nThere are many mud guard options on the market, all offering varying levels of protection. And you'll find actually that some clubs do insist that riders use mud guards during the winter months. It's rather unsociable to have muddy water flying off your back wheel into the face of the rider behind you.\n\nThat said, they can be a little bit of a faff to fit. And it does depend a little bit on your bike so it's worth doing a little bit of research before you do invest. But do make sure you fit them correctly because there's nothing worse than having a rubbing mud guard or one that falls off every time you go over a pot hole.\n\nA less permanent option is using an ass saver which just slots underneath your saddle so it's very easy to put on but it probably won't protect the rider behind you. Although hopefully it'll keep your back a little dryer.\n\nOver the winter we tend to have less light in the mornings and evenings but don't let that hamp your training. If you plan on training before or after work you will want to invest in some lights.\n\nIf you find these tips helpful, don't forget to give the video a thumbs up like and let us know you own training tips in the comments below üëá\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3t\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/3u\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nGOTTA GET BACK 1 - MARTIN LANDH\nHIP HOP LAID BACK - BF\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Ask GTN With Pieter Heemeryck - http://gtn.io/AskGTNPH\nüìπ  Trail Running Tips - http://gtn.io/Trailrunning\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
