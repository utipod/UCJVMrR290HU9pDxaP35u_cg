title = "GTN's Beginner Track Running Workout: How To Get Started Running On A Track"
description = "Starting running on a track can be quite daunting. But as long as you go down with a detailed plan of exactly you want to get out of a session, it can be very effective for your training. Mark and Heather detail a good beginner session for you here.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/4V\n\nThanks to Club La Santa for the locations used in this shoot.\n\nMake sure you have a solid warm up before performing any efforts on a track. A ten minute jog coupled with some dynamic stretching is ideal. Finally, just before starting your session perform 3 sets of strides of increasing intensity, from 80 - 100% effort.\n\nA great session to get started running on the track is doing 8x400m at your 5km pace. Between each effort take 60 seconds of walking recovery. If you run a 20 minute 5km, you would be looking at 1min 36s per lap.\n\nOnce you have finished your efforts, make sure you warm down well. Some static stretching will kickstart your recovery, just make sure you put on some warm clothing first.\n\nLet us know how you get on in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/4W\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nHow to warm up before your run http://gtn.io/RunWarmUp2 üìπ \nGTN's Running playlist http://gtn.io/runwithGTN üìπ \n\nMusic: Sleeping In My Head (Instrumental Version) - Albin Lewin\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
