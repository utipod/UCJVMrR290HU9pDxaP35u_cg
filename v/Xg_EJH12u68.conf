description = "Welcome back to the Triathlon Training Explained show - this week we're discussing winter and how best to train during the colder months. Should you be doing lots of base/endurance work or is it best to keep the intensity? See what Mark, Heather and triathlon coach Rob Wilby have to say in this video...\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/fy\n\nIn association with TrainingPeaks - http://gtn.io/TrainingPeaks\n\nUseful TrainingPeaks articles:\nWinter Base Training Myth: http://gtn.io/fD\nMaximise Winter Base Training: http://gtn.io/fE\nWinter Base Into Spring Speed: http://gtn.io/fF\n\nWinter Base Training has been the go-to method for many athletes over the years, which may work fine for the pros, but there is an increased thinking that this isn‚Äôt quite so good for the time-crunched amateur triathletes. So, today we‚Äôre going to be exploring this debate regarding the winter base training myth.\n\nThe main focus during this early part of the season is to develop a solid aerobic and endurance base. Hence the name base training...or you could think of it as building foundations on which more intensive, high-end training can be built as you approach your race season.\n\nFor most people, this involves adding some strength work - like hills reps, some threshold work, and finally some top end speed work. How much you do of each may vary a little depending on the athlete and the target race distance...but one thing that normally stays the same is this long aerobic base phase. \n\nLet‚Äôs refer to an interesting study from 2008, by exercise physiologist Karl Burgomaster. It showed that a HIIT training...or high-intensity interval training...could give us similar benefits. The study concluded that the relatively short, high-intensity sessions actually helped to stimulate that mitochondrial development - and therefore the amount of oxygen being transported to the muscles. In addition, they claimed it to also enhance endurance capacity. And that is not the only study of its kind.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/fx\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nStructure Your Training üìπ http://gtn.io/TriathlonTrainingExplained\nTraining With No Time üìπ http://gtn.io/TrainWithNoTime\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nFollow Me (Instrumental Version) - Otto Wallgren\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
