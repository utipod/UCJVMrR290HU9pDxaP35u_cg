title = "How To Remove Your Wetsuit Quickly | Improve Your Triathlon Transition Time"
description = "Removing your wetsuit with speed is the key. There's no point in taking two minutes off your swim time if you're just gonna spend five minutes battling to get your wetsuit off in transition. Use the last stage of your swim just to visualise the process you're going to go through in your transition and then try and stay relaxed, control your breathing and try not to get too flustered as you come out of the water. \n\nSo, as you come out of the water just pop your goggles onto your head. You do see quite a few athletes who will take their hat and goggles right off and then they struggle as they've only got one free hand to take off their wetsuit. So, once you've found even footing, the next step is just to simply undo your wetsuit. \n\nThe next step is to get your arms out and it's important to do one, then the other because if you try and do both at once, you're quite likely to end up stuck and possibly looking like a penguin. Once your arms are free, peel your wetsuit down to your waist and now you can run into your transition area and this is the moment you take your hat and goggles off and just carry them in your hand. \n\nSo, once you've got into your transition zone, it's time to get your wetsuit the rest of the way off. Start by peeling it down and then it's going to be one leg at a time for the final bit. If when you get to this stage, you feel a little wobbly or you're out of breath, then there's no harm in just taking a seat and pulling it off one leg at a time. \n\nSo, once you've got your wetsuit completely off your legs, you just need to make sure you store it within your transition area before you start putting your cycling kit on. Finally, one last little tip, just add a bit of lubrication around your wrists and your ankles as that will help you get your wetsuit off with a little more ease.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/3O\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/3P\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCause I Am Coming Home (Elphick Remix)\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Run Train Like A Pro - http://gtn.io/runsmart\nüìπ  Open Water Swim Tips - http://gtn.io/OpenWater\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
