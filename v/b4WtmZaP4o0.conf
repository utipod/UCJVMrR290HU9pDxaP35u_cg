description = "When it comes to balancing triathlon training with your work and family life, it can be pretty tough. So, we are joined by pro triathlete and cancer doctor, Lucy Gossage to help you make the most of your training with a time-efficient sweet spot workout. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/6R\n\nLucy Gossage is a pro triathlete who manages to balance the life of pro triathlon training with being a cancer doctor. To get the most out of her training,  Lucy makes sure every session has a purpose and has cut out a lot of the junk miles she did as a full time athlete.\n\nLucy's tips to help fit her training in, include using her commute to ensure she gets her run mileage in, often swimming in the morning and then running to work. When it comes to cycling, she has cut out a lot of the junk miles she used to do as a full time athlete and now makes sure each session has a structure, roughly equating 1hr30 on the turbo to 3hrs on the road.\n\nLucy takes us through one of her time-efficient workouts that she uses to help fit training around working life:\n- 8-10 reps of around 6-7mins\n- Overgearing with a cadence of 50-60rpm.\n- An Intensity of 76-90% of your FTP, or 84-94% of your Threshold HR, or on a perceived effort scale of 1-10, around a 7.\n- 3 minute recovery between each rep. \n\nIf you liked this video, give it a thumbs up and if you have any question about balancing work life and training then leave them in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/6Q\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  How To Train With Power - http://gtn.io/trainwithpower\nüìπ  How To Cycle Like A Pro - http://gtn.io/BikePro\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
