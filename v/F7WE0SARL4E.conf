description = "The brick workout - what is it, and what are its benefits to your triathlon training and racing.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/cP\n\nIf you have done a triathlon before, you‚Äôll likely have experienced that dreaded 'jelly legs' feeling. Sadly, you‚Äôll never completely get rid of that feeling (that‚Äôs just part and parcel of triathlon) but you can definitely reduce it, and get used to it.\n\nThese workouts have become extremely popular, and you‚Äôd be hard pushed to find a triathlete that doesn‚Äôt do them. The idea is that you go from one discipline to next in quick succession, and therefore testing the body in the same way that it will be on race-day. After all, it‚Äôs no good being a super swimmer, super biker, and super runner, if you can‚Äôt put them all together.\n\nSo, Mark is going to be doing a bike-run brick session. This is probably the most popular type of brick session you‚Äôll come across as it‚Äôs the easiest to perform, unless you‚Äôre able to jump on your bike straight out of a swimming pool. \n\nThey can be really tough sessions! So, most triathletes keep it to just one hard quality brick session per week. But, there is no harm in doing other easier sessions during your week back-to-back, in a ‚Äòbrick‚Äô session format. It can also be a great way of just getting it done, and freeing time up in your day.\n\nHow many 'brick workouts' do you do per week?
