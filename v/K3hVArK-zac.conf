An invitational race series for pro triathletes streamed live for our viewing pleasure. We saw the likes of Lionel Sanders racing head-to-head with Alistair Brownlee, and sprint finishes between Flora Duffy and Lucy Charles-Barclay. It was action-packed, and it‚Äôs back - but this time with a rather exciting twist.\n\nWe wanted to see first hand what it is all about, so Mark has been to Joe Skipper to see how tough this series is! \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Triathlon Mistakes & How To Learn From Them With Joe Skipperüëâ https://gtn.io/ProMistakes\nüìπ  10 Hacks You Need To Know About Zwift! üëâ https://gtn.io/ZwiftHacks\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\nES_Antagonistic - _91nova\nES_Calendula - Sarah, the Illstrumentalist\nES_Fast Vision - Damma Beatz\nES_Nep Tune - Dugway\nES_Bad Sign - Ballpoint.mp3\nES_Can't Chill - Dylan Sitts.mp3\nES_Embody - Ballpoint.mp3\nES_Froot Loops - Jobii.mp3\nES_Graduation - Dylan Sitts.mp3\nES_LFE Impact Bass - SFX Producer.mp3\nES_Na Na Na - Ballpoint.mp3\nES_Somewhere Above - Gerard Franklin.mp3\nES_They Don't Know - Damma Beatz.mp3\nES_This House - Gregory David.mp3\nES_Win It Back - Damma Beatz.mp3\n\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
