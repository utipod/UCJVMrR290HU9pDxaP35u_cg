title = "How To Choose A Bike Saddle For Triathlon"
description = "The saddle is one of three contact points between the bike and yourself, and it takes a considerable amount of your body weight. With that in mind, here is GTN's guide on which saddle to choose for triathlon.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/88\n\nWith the amount of time cyclists spend on their bike, it‚Äôs hardly surprising to hear so many complaints about saddles and the amount of discomfort people experience from them. As triathletes, we like to lean forward and use aero bars, putting even more pressure on some rather sensitive areas. \n\nIt is worth noting that a saddle is never going to feel like a armchair. Even with the best suited saddle it will still include bouts of discomfort, numbness and pain from time-to-time. Fortunately though, there are lots of saddles to choose from that are suitable to all needs.\n\nBeyond the classic road saddle, there are a number of triathlon and time trial specific saddles. These include:\n- Those with extra comfort and padding.\n- Those with a cut-out section to relieve pressure.\n- Those with a short nose (often in a split nose style).\n\nMark explores the various options available however, if you have any more questions, make sure to ask them in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you found this video useful don't forget to give it a thumbs up and share it with your triathlon and cycling friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/87\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Getting A Professional Bike Fit | Everything You Need To Know - http://gtn.io/GTNbikefit\nüìπ How To Adapt Your Road Bike To A Triathlon Bike - http://gtn.io/RoadToTriBike\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
