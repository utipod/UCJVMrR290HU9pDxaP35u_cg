title = "Should Celebrities Race At The Ironman Triathlon World Championships? | The GTN Show Ep. 8"
description = "This week we bring you the latest triathlon race news, new tri technology and discuss who gets to race at the Ironman Triathlon World Championships in Kona. Don't forget the GTN Show is for every triathlete, swimmer, cyclist and runner!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/2n\n\nA huge thanks for all of your likes, comments, shares and subscribes so far.\n\nIn last weeks poll we asked who you thought would win the women's event in Kona. There was a clear winner with 79% of you choosing Daniela Ryf, less than two weeks to find out if you are correct! This week we ask you whether celebrities should be allowed to race in Kona?\n\nThis week we discuss whether celebrities such as British chef Gordon Ramsay should be racing in Kona. These people are allocated spaces due to their fame or charity contributions rather than triathlon merit. Is this fair? We also discuss the latest technology including a heart rate variability monitor on kickstarter, a smart shoe/insole and a power meter for the pool.\n\nEven with the focus of triathlon on Kona, there was another really exciting week of racing with Ironman Barcelona, Ironman Taiwan and the final Otillo SwimRun event of the series at the 1000 Lakes Race in Germany.\n\nAs well as the latest in all things triathlon, we have our usual segments such as the #GTNPainCave and CAPtion competition.\n\nWe hope you enjoy episode 8 of the GTN Show, let us know what you think in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/2m\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Trail Running | The Ultimate guide - http://gtn.io/Trailrunning\nüìπ  How To Fix A Race Day Puncture - http://gtn.io/PunctureRepair\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
