title = "What Is The Best Way To Draft Whilst Swimming?"
description = "Drafting during the swim can lead to a big advantage, but which is more effective, swimming on the hips or swimming on the feet? GTN discuss how to swim faster for no extra effort!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/1o\n\nThere is a huge advantage to drafting off another swimmer. But which is more effective... drafting on the hips vs drafting on the feet?\n\nFirstly, there are two approaches to drafting, either make it easier or to improve your speed. To make the swim easier, draft off someone a similar pace to you. To improve your speed, draft off someone faster!\n\nDrafting on the hips should feel like surfing the wake of the swimmer in front of you. This will slow the swimmer being drafted down due to the occasional knock and the increased drag caused by the drafter. To make this drafting effective you should get as close as possible, lining your head up with the other swimmers hips.\n\nDrafting on the feet isn't as easy as drafting on the hips however will result in a faster swim as you do not slow the lead swimmer down. You should be swimming as close to the toes of the swimmer in front as possible.\n\nWhether on the hips or feet, if you get dropped  you should accelerate as soon as possible to get back on. This will be very worthwhile in the long run!\n\nGood luck and make sure to practise before your next event.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç  http://gtn.io/1n\n\nWatch more on GTN...\n\nüìπ  4 Swim Workouts - http://gtn.io/SwimWorkouts\nüìπ  9 Open Water Swim Tips - http://gtn.io/OpenWater\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub"
