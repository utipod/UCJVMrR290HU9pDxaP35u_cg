title = "How To Plan & Prepare The Night Before A Triathlon | Be Race Day Ready"
description = "You‚Äôve probably been training for your event for several months and putting in hours of hard work, so don‚Äôt let any silly mistakes or panics ruin your day. Being prepared in advance will not only ensure you are more relaxed, but you‚Äôre less likely to forget something important.\n\nWe have a step by step guide to help you make sure you‚Äôre fully prepared the night before your big day. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/8Z\n\nCheck and pack as much of your kit as you can the night before. \nStarting with the bike, if you haven‚Äôt already racked it then do a final run through the gears, check over the tyres for any signs of wear, make sure your chain is clean and lubed. Also, check that everything is put back together properly if you‚Äôd had to dismantle it for travel.  \n\nPack your transition bag methodically. Use a list and check off everything as you put it in. If you have a race with a split transition prepare your kit in two bags the night before. It might be worth checking the weather forecast as well as to what you will want to wear on the bike and run. \n\nFinally go through everything in your head, almost like a mental checklist. Sit down and take a moment for this. If you know the course then walk yourself through it step by step as though you‚Äôre in your race. Think about what you‚Äôll be wearing, eating and drinking at each stage and picture the route. If need be, you can recheck the course online to help you prepare. \n\nAnd then it's time to relax! Take a bath, shave your legs, read your book, whatever it is that finishes off that feeling of being totally prepared. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/8Y\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ First Triathlon Training Plan Series - http://gtn.io/FirstTriathlonSeries\nüìπ 10 Rules You Need To Know Before You First Triathlon - http://gtn.io/TriRules\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
