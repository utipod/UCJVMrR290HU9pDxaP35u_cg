We've made a Half Marathon training plan for you to reach your next goal!\n\nHere's the link to your Half Marathon training plan üëâ https://gtn.io/HalfPlan\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/uw\n\nThe first distance goal in running is usually 5k followed by 10k.
