description = "When you're training on your own in the water it's easy to fall into bad habits. Mark and Fraser are here to show you how to analyse and improve your stroke.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/jX\n\nIn association with TrainingPeaks\n\nFraser and Mark have popped up to Team Bath for a spot of swimming and Fraser is quite keen to get some help with his technique.\n\nMaybe you haven‚Äôt had anyone look at your technique for some time which means you may have fallen into some bad habits.\n\nUnless you‚Äôre part of a swim or triathlon club, then it‚Äôs unlikely you have a coach overseeing your swimming and giving you pointers on your technique, making it very hard to make improvements.\n\nBut perhaps you‚Äôre jumping in to the pool with a training partner who may be able to help. We thought we‚Äôd bring you guys along to show you how you can analyse and improve your own frontcrawl technique.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - https://gtn.io/jW\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ The Catch - How To Swim Front Crawl | Freestyle Swimming Technique üëâ https://gtn.io/FrontCrawlCatch\nüìπ The Pull - How To Swim Front Crawl | Freestyle Swimming Technique üëâ https://gtn.io/FrontCrawlPull\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\n\nAll The Feels - Sarah, the Illstrumentalist\nFlippa Club - Homebody\nMaybe We'll Get There (Instrumental Version) - Ameryh\nMultidimensional - Sarah, the Illstrumentalist\nNot Long Ago (Instrumental Version) - Ameryh\nSick Days - Dylan Sitts (1)\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
