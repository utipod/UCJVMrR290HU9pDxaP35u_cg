Recording heart rate has now become one of the more obvious parameters to use when analysing our effort levels in training or a race, but where did all of this start?\n\nIt was in Finland where Polar designed the first wearable heart rate monitor back in 1977, a ground breaking move at the time. Since then, the technology has progressed significantly so in this video, we are going to be looking inside the Polar HQ to find out more about what goes on!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/dv\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Run Using Heart Rate Zones | Running Training For Triathlon - http://gtn.io/RunHRZones\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nAlways In Bloom (Instrumental Version) - Frigga\nBack When - Seamus McNamara\nHeart Mending - Lonov \nJust You And Me (Instrumental Version) - Sebastian Forslund\nNerdy But Cool Beat 1 - Jonatan JaÃàrpehag\nNordic Poptastic 3 - Jack Elphick\nNordic Poptastic 5 - Jack Elphick\nOur Jam (Instrumental Version) - Da Tooby\nPoser (Instrumental Version) - Paisley Pink\nRobot Empire 4 - Niklas AhlstroÃàm\nRockin Beat Nr 31 - Jack Elphick\nSummer's End - Benjamin Kling\nWhak - Wesky\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first-timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro-know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCanyon bikes: http://gtn.io/canyon-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq power meters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nZwift: http://gtn.io/zwift\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
