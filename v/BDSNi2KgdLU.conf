title = "6 Things To Avoid Before You Run | Common Running Mistakes"
description = "Running is a very dynamic and physical sport, so there are a number of things you probably want to avoid just before heading out for a run. We‚Äôve tried these over the years and have learnt the lessons for you, so here are 6 things you shouldn‚Äôt do before a run!\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/6N\n\nYou wake up starving and just want to get breakfast in! Now, this might seem like an obvious one, but the worst thing you can do is stuff your face full with heavy food just before heading out for a run. It can be surprising how ‚Äúhungry‚Äù you can feel and still go out for a run and feel good once you‚Äôre out there. Ideally, try to plan your day so that your eating and runs are at least 1 hour to 90mins apart. And if you have to eat within this time then make sure it is something light like a cereal bar or energy bar.\n\nEven though there are lot of fizzy energy drinks out there, they‚Äôre not always the best thing to go for just before a run. The carbonation of fizzy drinks it can make you feel really uncomfortable on a run. So, fizzy drinks tend to sit in your stomach longer than still ones and aren‚Äôt ingested as quickly. This causes more sloshing around and actually they end up hydrating you less. And on top of that, fizzy drinks can also prevent you from ingesting nutrients from food already in your stomach. So stick to still drinks and don‚Äôt drink less than 10 to 15 minutes before a run.\n\nCaffeine can be great for sports performance, especially in endurance sports. But the timing of its consumption can be crucial when wanting to avoid mid-run embarrassment! I know this might sound a bit crude but it‚Äôs something you should genuinely think about before runs. So, if you have had a quick perk-you-up caffeinated delight, make sure you give yourself at least half an hour or one trip to the toilet before you head out!\n\nIf you liked this video, don't forget to give it a thumbs up and we would love to hear some of your stories and tips too so leave them in the comments below üëá\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link üëç http://gtn.io/6P\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nGoofy Clown - Merlean\nMarch Of The Ducks 10 - HaÃäkan Eriksson\nSunshine Stroll 02 - HaÃäkan Eriksson\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ GTN's Long Run Training Guide - http://gtn.io/LongRun\nüìπ 5 Pro Triathlon Training Hacks - http://gtn.io/TrainingHacks\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
