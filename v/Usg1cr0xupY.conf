title = "The Paddy Buckley Round Ultramarathon: Why We Failed!"
description = "Snowdonia National Park in Wales covers 823 square miles with 9 mountain ranges and 15 mountains over 3000ft. It's also home to the Paddy Buckley Round, an enormous run, measuring 105km with an elevation of almost 7387 metres. It's not a race, but an arbitrary 24-hour time limit does exist as a cap on the challenge. This is another one of Sam and Mark's better ideas! Here's why they failed. \n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: https://gtn.io/Ut\n\nDo you think you could tackle this monumental challenge? \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends. üëç\n\nSubmit your content here:\nhttps://upload.globaltrinetwork.com/\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ  Triathlon Vs Crossfit: https://gtn.io/VsCrossFit\nüìπ  How Do you run with data?: https://gtn.io/RunWatchData\n \nMusic - licensed by Epidemic Sound:\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the world's biggest triathlon YouTube channel, with new videos every day!
