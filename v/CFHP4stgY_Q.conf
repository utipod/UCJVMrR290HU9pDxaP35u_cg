title = "Aero Vs. Road Helmet | Which Is The Best Bike Helmet For Triathlon?"
description = "An aero helmet is designed for being fast, but how much of an advantage would you get from racing in an aero helmet over a road helmet during your next triathlon?\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/9X\n\nIn a wind tunnel an aero helmet will easily win over a road helmet, but in reality it isn‚Äôt that straight forward. There are a lot of factors to consider when choosing what to use in your next race.  \n\nBear in mind the type of course and conditions that you‚Äôll be racing in. You might have a super streamlined position riding on your turbo or out on smooth flat roads... but if your race course has lots of sharp corners, steep hills or strong winds that will cause you to come off your aero bars and onto your base bars the you might even be better off with a normal road helmet. \n\nWe also consider the climate, cost, weight and the race distance when deciding which helmet will be faster for your next triathlon.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/9W\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ Time Trial Vs Road Bike: What's The Best Triathlon Bike For A Technical Course? - http://gtn.io/TTvroadtechnical\nüìπ How To Get Aero | Find The Ultimate Aerodynamic Position With Bart Aernouts - http://gtn.io/BartAernoutsAeroTips\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nCar Chase Rock And Roll 6 - Victor Olsson\nHeavy 80s Sleaze 8 - Victor Olsson\nSan Diego Tools 5 - Stefan Netsman\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nOrca: http://gtn.io/Orca\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nRoka: http://gtn.io/roka\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
