title = "How To Run Using Heart Rate Zones | Running Training For Triathlon"
description = "Running well is not always about training hard, it‚Äôs about training smart. Using the heart rate zones in your triathlon training is a great way to tailor your plan. In this video, GTN explain how and when to train using heart rate, and the benefits it can bring to your running.\n\nSubscribe to GTN: http://gtn.io/SubscribetoGTN\nCheck out the GTN Shop: http://gtn.io/8g\n\nZONE 1\n100-120bpm, 50-60% \nThis is super easy, you'll hardly working and might well wonder why it‚Äôs even worth running at this pace. It‚Äôs a good idea to make this run social, you should feel like you‚Äôre out enjoying life and not training as it‚Äôs all about recovery and flushing your legs out. \n\nZONE 2\n120-140bpm, 60-70%\nWe‚Äôre staying in the aerobic zone here, it‚Äôs moderately light training but a step up from zone 1. You‚Äôre building your aerobic base in this zone, this could be your long 1 hour run with a friend, holding a conversation is a good sign you‚Äôre working at the right level. \n\nZONE 3\n140-160bpm, 70-80%\nThis is zone is used less commonly when training to HR but it‚Äôs the grey area that athletes often slip into as you‚Äôre not pushing up your lactate threshold but you‚Äôre working too hard to be purely building aerobic base. That said, your coach might set zone 3 work early on in your base training as it will help to build muscular endurance and can make your body more efficient.\n\nZONE 4 \n160-180bpm, 80-90%\nThis is where the hard work happens and it won‚Äôt feel comfortable. This training will improve your speed endurance and lactate tolerance as you‚Äôll be close to, or in, your threshold zone throughout this effort. If you‚Äôre targeting sprint or Olympic you'll be running close to your race pace in these sessions.\n\nZONE 5\nOver 180 bpm, 90-100%\nYou won‚Äôt be able to stay in this zone long as 90-100% of your max is over your lactate threshold and basically all out. Lactic acid will soon catch up with you and prevent your muscles from working in this zone very quickly. Note that in the lag time needed for your heart rate to reach your max, you're legs may well have failed you.\n\nIf you liked this video and found it helpful then don't forget to give it a thumbs up and share it with your triathlon and running friends üëç\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link - http://gtn.io/8f\n\nWatch more on GTN...\nüìπ How To Train With A Heart Rate Monitor - http://gtn.io/RunHR\nüìπ How To Lose Weight Through Triathlon - http://gtn.io/LoseWeight\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\nXilo - vvano\nDubstep Mammoth 2 - Cecilia Lindh\n\nPhotos: ¬© Triathlon / Getty Images\n\nThe Global Triathlon Network (GTN) is the best triathlon YouTube channel, with videos for anyone who loves triathlon: from seasoned Ironman racers to first timers ‚Äì and everyone in between.\n\nWith the help of our pro and Olympic medal winning team, we‚Äôre here to inform, entertain and inspire you to become a better triathlete; including videos on:\n\nHow to swim, bike, and run faster with expert knowledge\nBeat your PB with record-breaking expertise\nGet the best from your bike and gear with pro know-how\nIn-depth, entertaining features from the heart of the sport\nChat, opinion and interact with us across the channel and on social media every week\n\nJoin us on YouTube‚Äôs best triathlon channel to get closer to the sport and to become a better, faster and fitter triathlete.\n\nWelcome to the Global Triathlon Network.\n\nThanks to our sponsors:\nCervelo bikes: http://gtn.io/cervelo\nBMC Switzerland: http://gtn.io/bmc-bikes\nON Running: http://gtn.io/On-Running\nAssos of Switzerland clothing: http://gtn.io/Assos\nKASK helmets: http://gtn.io/kask\nPark Tool: http://gtn.io/parktool\nProfile Design: http://gtn.io/profiledesign\nZipp wheels: http://gtn.io/zipp\nENVE wheels: http://gtn.io/ENVE-wheels\nQuarq powermeters: http://gtn.io/quarq\nPolar: http://gtn.io/polar\nVision wheels: http://gtn.io/vision \nContinental: http://gtn.io/continental\nTeam Bath: http://gtn.io/TeamBath\n\nYouTube Channel - http://gtn.io/YouTube\nFacebook - http://gtn.io/Facebook\nInstagram - http://gtn.io/Instagram\nTwitter - http://gtn.io/Twitter\nGoogle+ - http://gtn.io/GooglePlus\nStrava Club - http://gtn.io/stravaclub\nGMBN Tech - http://gmbn.tech/subscribe\nGCN Tech - http://gcntech.co/subscribe\nEMBN - http://embn.me/subscribe"
